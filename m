You are on the right track here, but the format of the child-address 
portion of the above ranges property is incorrect.  Since the child 
address space is the PCI address space, the child-address portion needs 
to be 3 cells.  It's not a linear address but rather a triple.  The 
first cell identifies the address type (config, I/O, memory..) and the 
second and third cells are offsets within that subspace.  The second and 
third cells will typically be 0.  The PCI binding has details.
