The current DT binding documentation is not ideal as it is just free form
text with at most only a loose structure. This makes reviewing bindings a
manual process. The bindings are often duplicating information that's
already defined elsewhere and missing information one would need to
validate a DTS file. The examples in binding documents are not built and
a source of lots of typos sometimes found in review and sometimes not.
Secondly, there's no verification that DTS files match what the
documentation says. While dtc does do some checking (and has gained more
recently), it can't do per binding checks as it would have to understand
thousands of compatible strings to match on.

There's been a number of proposals over the years to address validation.
They've all suffered from inventing their own validation language and the
effort it would take to fully define and flush out a validation language.
Enter json-schema. The language has a defined specification, maps well to
DT data, and there are numerous existing tools which can be leveraged.
The actual DT schema doc files are stored as YAML using only a JSON
compatible subset. YAML is considered more human readable allowing
comments for example.

This series adds the build support, some documentation, and converts
some bindings (mostly ARM board/soc bindings). The tools, core schema,
and meta-schema are in a separate repository[1]. This might eventually
be integrated with dtc or added to the kernel, but for now I plan to
keep it separate.

This series is available here[2]. The branch also has a doc2yaml script
which can help convert binding files. It's not perfect, but works pretty
well considering the input is free form text.

My plan is to merge this initial support for v4.21. There's not yet any
requirement that new bindings be submitted using the schema. I think that
should wait a bit until after this gets a bit more exposure. I do have
some tooling in place to test submitted patches and update DT patchwork
with the result.


SoC maintainers,
The board/soc bindings can go thru your trees if there are conflicts (if
any SoC or board is added). It shouldn't matter if they go in separately
from the build support. shmobile, rockchip, fsl and amlogic already have
conflicts with next. Otherwise, I can take them via the DT tree.

v2:
 - Rebase to v4.20-rc2
 - Add some missing Xilinx boards (from Michal Simek)
 - Add ability to validate with a single specified schema using
   the DT_SCHEMA_FILES variable.
 - Add back some dropped comments for board names
 - Various maintainer fixes
 - Rework ARM PMU interrupts schema.
 - Updates to ARM CPU vendor specific properties.
 - Add i2c-gpio conversion to json-schema. Serves as example of including
   another schema (i2c-controller.yaml)
 - Set license on schema files to GPL-2.0
 - Improvements to writing-schema.md and annotated example.
