I'm not sure those resources either cover all the necessary regions, nor
are as fine-grained as they should be ...

In particular, in pcie.c, I see separate afi_writel() and pads_writel()
implying those are separate regions.

Also, I see the following hard-code specific addresses, and are still
used by the driver after conversion:

> #define PREFETCH_MEM_BASE_1     (PREFETCH_MEM_BASE_0 + PREFETCH_MEM_SIZE_0)
> #define PREFETCH_MEM_SIZE_1     SZ_128M

Also, there's a comment describing the register layout in terms of a
number of separate regions:

(the latter 2 regions at least being also split in half for each of the
2 host ports)

Shouldn't each of these regions be a separate entry in the platform
device resources.

This perhaps isn't that relevant for Tegra20 alone, but Tegra30 supports
3 host ports instead of 2 (hence I presume alters the internal layout of
the 1G chunk of physical memory space allocated to PCIe), and moves the
PCIe area from 2G..3G to 0G..1G (so invalidates the hard-coded
*_MEM_BASE_* above).

That said, I'm not sure whether Tegra20's and Tegra30's PCIe controllers
are similar enough to make a shared driver worthwhile/possible.
(Although our downstream Android driver appears to handle both with a
very small number of ifdefs). If they are similar, then I think my
comments above should be addressed. If they are not similar, then I
think you can just have a single 1G memory region in the resources, and
split it up internally, rather than needing separate resources for
different parts of the address space.

While we can easily fix this kind of driver internals so this doesn't
seem like a big deal, this kind of change would impact the device tree
binding, so it seems that we need to sort it out before DT conversion.
