Yes, I agree.

The main issue is the multiple tree for the different drivers making
hard to track, modify and improve the drivers in one shot.

It is not the first time, a modification of the cpuidle framework
implied to modify all the drivers.

When Rob introduced the first code consolidation, that took months to
add a simple flag in the drivers because we had to wait for the merge
before the changes in drivers/cpuidle/cpuidle.c were visible.

That would be *really* great. If we can do that for all the drivers,
that will solve the multi-location / multi-tree problem.

The u8500 driver will be moved soon to this directory also.

I did some modifications around the at91 some months ago to encapsulate
the code more, maybe it could be also a good candidate. Nicolas ?

=46or OMAP3 that could be a bit more difficult. Who is maintaining the
driver now ?

I Cc'ed the different maintainers for the other boards, may be they can
react ?

Thanks
