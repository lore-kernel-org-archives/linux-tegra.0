Yes makes sense. However, after this series, the
pm_genpd_remove_device/subdomain really become provider only APIs
because clients can no longer get access to the genpd struct. Although
today none of the users of the new of_genpd_add_device/subdomain do any
clean-up on failure, it is possible that someone may. Therefore, I was
thinking that we should have a way for a client to remove a subdomain or
device it has added.

Does that make sense? I guess we could always add those as needed.

I am looking at a use-case for usb where we are populating the
pm-domains at runtime and we may need to clean-up on failure. However, I
can always wait to add more APIs until we really need them.

Let me know what you think about my response to patch 6/8.

Cheers
Jon
