The goal I'm working towards right now is to have the platform specific
code continue to register the devices that are inside the SoC. Then use
the device tree to register all other on board devices.

This patch doesn't accomplish the whole goal in one step, but gets the
code a little closer toward this goal.

To accomplish the goal, nodes need to be in the device tree for the
devices inside the SoC. This is then used to attach device tree nodes to
the existing devices - gives us a "hook" on which to "hang" the board
specific devices. There is only one device tree used, so everything
needs to be connected into the same device tree.

These patches just get the i2c controller and driver instantiated. This
includes having the platform code to register the i2c controller in the
"normal" fashion. This patch also gets a device tree node attached to
the i2c device.

A following patch, which I'll send later this week/early next week, will
instantiate the wm8903 audio codec device solely from the device tree.

Hopefully this makes the plan a little clearer. Let me know if you have
any questions.
