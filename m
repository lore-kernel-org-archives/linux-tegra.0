I think having separate Fn map is OK since, as Stephen correctly
mentioned, it usually emulates as Fn works in AT keyboards, i.e.
completely hidden by the firmware. Also the set of keys produced by Fn
is usually "control"-like and requiring keymaps would stop clients
listening on /dev/input/eventX from recognizing them.

Here is what I wrote to Rakesh:

The Shift, Ctrl and other modifiers, on the other hand, should be done
in userspace so that standard locale-specific keymap could be loaded and
used.
