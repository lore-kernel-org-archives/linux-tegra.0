(2) and (3) don't sound like per-cpu modes but system modes.  If you're
having to disable L2, then your other CPU can't be active.

GIC can be handled in just the same way - upon a CPU idling and it
being decided that the CPU should enter low power mode, the idle states
are entered which does what's required with TWD, L1, VFP, Neon, etc.
We just need the GIC CPU interface included in there.

When both CPUs are idled, then the L2 comes into play, and then modes
(2) and (3) become possible and this is where you start doing the extra
stuff.

Note that you have to do it that way anyway, because you can't save
the state of the other CPU's GIC without doing an IPI call, which
could kick it out of its idle mode.
