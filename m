I tried to avoid having to set this from each platform separately,
and all users of ARCH_HAS_RESET_CONTROLLER on ARM are also
based on ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM. The other platforms are lagging behind
in their conversion and use neither reset controllers not
multiplatform. If anyone wants to make them use reset controllers,
we probably want them to use multiplatform as well.

We could of course change it in one direction or another, but it
didn't seem urgent here.

We can do that too, either way works for me, and we are using both
in other parts of the kernel. REGMAP is an example for another subsystem
that gets selected by each driver that relies on the framework.

The practical difference is only in the case that the subsystem
is enabled (e.g. by using ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM) but all reset drivers
are disabled. A device driver using the API in one case will see
the stubbed-out inline helpers and not contain any object code
that relies on non-NULL return values from them, while in the
other case it calls into the subsystem code to get the same
return value at runtime.

If you volunteer to clean up my patch, feel free to choose between
the two options as you like.
