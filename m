To be fair I'm not entirely sure either why this causes a hang, I
haven't read the TRM...  The iomem has been mapped at this point,
so accessing the register should work.  One clue is when you look
at _bar1_init(), the 0x1704 register is initialised with
some (device instance?) memory address.  So it's possible that
the hardware does something special when you set this to 0 as in
_bar1_fini(), which may fail in particular if it was previously
not initialised with a valid address.

This is merely guesswork, would be interested to find out the
real explanation though.

Thanks!
