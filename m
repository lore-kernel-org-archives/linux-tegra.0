Ok. I was not sure if it would seem odd to add pm_genpd_remove() and
genpd_remove() in the same patch because pm_genpd_remove() is the only
user of genpd_remove(). However, it would simplify the diff and so I am
fine with that.

I think that I would prefer either of_genpd_remove_last() or
of_genpd_remove_one(). Although _first is accurate from the list
perspective it seems odd from the user perspective. I think that _last
is more meaningful as we are removing the last that was added regardless
or how things appear on the list. Alternatively, _one could be a good
compromise.

Ok.
