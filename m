While thinking through the problem of devices associated with multiple Power
domains (or power resources) and controlling them individually (or together)
I was wondering if something like a PM domain governor (with PM resource 
level constraints) could help.

So with just one set of PM domain callbacks, its quite easy to control multiple power
resources, if they need to be *all* turned on/off together, using something similar to
what Jon proposed in his RFC [1]

However, there could be instances where in we might need to control them individually
and in such cases we could hook up a PM domain governor which decides if an individual
PM resource can be turned on or off while the device is runtime suspended/resumed.
We can expose some PM resource level QoS APIs which the drivers can use to express their
needs, which the PM domain governor then takes into account during the decision making.

if this seems worth pursuing further, I can post some RFCs on these lines and
get the discussion going.

thanks,
Rajendra
