Well I'm also OK with changing the determine_rate API one more
time, but we'll have to be careful. Invariably someone will push
a new clock driver through some non-clk tree path and we'll get
build breakage. They shouldn't be doing that, so either we do the
change now and push it to -next and see what breaks, or we do
this after -rc1 comes out and make sure everyone has lots of
warning.
