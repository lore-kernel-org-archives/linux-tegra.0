I don't have a clock that needs "immediate recalculation after setting
it's rate".  However the code is not incorrect as-is, just suboptimal.
 I'm not currently looking into improving this since I have bigger
problems to solve.  Patches are welcome, otherwise I'll toss it on the
back-burner and fix it up some day (not for initial 3.5 merge window).

Same as above.

Preemptive calls happen once only, in a cascade starting from the
"top" clock (which may or may not be the original clock in the
clk_set_rate call due to upwards parent propagation).

However we do recalc the rate for each clock (even after calling its
.set_rate callback) in clk_change_rate.  This could be improved, but
I'm not looking at it right now.

I still feel that, fundamentally, any clock which can output a
different rate than is fed into must implement .recalc_rates.  The set
of clocks which can output a different rate than their input often
exceeds the set of clocks that implement .set_rate (as evidenced by my
fixed-divide-by-2 example).  But forcing a check for .recalc_rate on
clocks that implement .set_rate at least helps us catch some which
should implement and do not.

For your PLLs which are fed from a fixed input clock, we can optimize
the code to not _call_ .recalc_rates unnecessarily.  But some day when
your chip changes and you have multiple inputs to your PLLs or an
adjustable rate parent you'll be glad you had .recalc_rates
implemented and ready to go.  It's simply a matter of correctness.

This is also worth thinking about, but it changes the existing
interfaces for clock code to implement and it's yet another
optimization.  So patches are welcome, otherwise I'll toss it onto the
stack somewhere.
