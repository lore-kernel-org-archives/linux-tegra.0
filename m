Hmmm. Very surprisingly (to me), this does indeed work fine, even with
an older gcc-4.4.1 I had lying around (after fixing the test inversion
in tegra_dt_init_late).

I believe U-Boot enabled -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections or similar
(recently?) to get this kind of behaviour. I wonder why the kernel
didn't need that. Perhaps -O2 is more aggressive (within a file at
least) than I thought.

I did note a few warnings due to the ifdefs in tegra_auxdata_lookup[]:

arch/arm/mach-tegra/tegra.c:47: warning: 'tegra_ehci1_pdata' defined but
not used
arch/arm/mach-tegra/tegra.c:58: warning: 'tegra_ehci2_pdata' defined but
not used
arch/arm/mach-tegra/tegra.c:65: warning: 'tegra_ehci3_pdata' defined but
not used

(I built a tegra_defconfig kernel and modified it to enable
Tegra30+Tegra114, disable Tegra20, disable DRM)
