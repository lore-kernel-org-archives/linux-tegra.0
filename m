Great, thanks.

Yes it may not be necessary. However, I was not sure if someone would
make use of the dev structure but not use RPM. For now we could drop it.

They don't have to be, and so I can move them.

Ok, yes good point.

So that would be ideal, however, I don't think it is that trivial and
hence this is why I have not done this for now.

I don't think that the async callbacks will really help here because if
you call enable_irq() and the chip is runtime suspended, you need to
wait for the chip to resume before you can enable the IRQ. I think that
the disable path would be ok, but not the enable. Plus there could be
some "hot" paths where enable/disable are used and I did not want to
make any assumptions about these.

This may appear ugly, but for something like this, we may need to have a
separate enable/disable API, such as
enable_irq_lazy()/disable_irq_lazy() which could be used to runtime
suspend/resume the chip and must not be used in critical sections.

I was hoping that we could get some initially functionality in place to
allow some basic support for these chips and then enhance it later.

Cheers
Jon
