It definitely makes sense to me, as the "power-domains" DT binding is not
limited to plain "power areas", but may refer to clock domains, too
(cfr. the Linux "PM Domain" notion).

For my (Renesas) use case, we have devices that are part of both a power
area and a clock domain. Currently this is handled by the power area driver
calling into the clock driver.

Thanks!
