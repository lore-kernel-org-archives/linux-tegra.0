(Thanks for pointing out the duplicate entries; I'll fix those.)

If we used names from the start, then the order would be irrelevant.

However, this binding didn't use names from the start, and hence the
order of appearance in "clocks" is part of the original binding.
"clock-names" only became part of the binding when the second clock was
introduced.

We can either: (a) document the existing requirements as I have done, or
(b) go through all the bindings and drivers and make potentially
incompatible changes so that all ordering is purely defined by
"clock-names". I was tempted to do (b) for cleanliness, but didn't want
to push my luck on too many ABI-incompatible changes. (b) /might/ also
affect more drivers than this series already does, thus bloating it even
more:-(

P.S. only quoting the parts of the patch you're replying to makes it a
lot easier and quicker to find your replies.
