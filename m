I've already suggested this approach:

diff --git a/arch/arm/include/asm/device.h b/arch/arm/include/asm/device.h
index dc662fc..51bb740 100644
--- a/arch/arm/include/asm/device.h
+++ b/arch/arm/include/asm/device.h
@@ -22,6 +22,7 @@ struct dev_archdata {
 struct omap_device;
 
 struct pdev_archdata {
+	u64 dma_mask;
 #ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_OMAP
 	struct omap_device *od;
 #endif

And then we can have dev->dma_mask pointed at that instead, which fully
eliminates any possible problems of things like dma_set_mask() interfering
with dma_set_coherent_mask().

Even better - because this is a common problem - would be to make 'dma_mask'
be a member of struct platform_device so that all arches can sort this
out once and for all (correction: generic code/drivers can in an arch-
independent way.)  IOW:

diff --git a/include/linux/platform_device.h b/include/linux/platform_device.h
index 9abf1db..121c74c 100644
--- a/include/linux/platform_device.h
+++ b/include/linux/platform_device.h
