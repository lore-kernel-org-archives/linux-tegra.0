The problem in that case is really the interrupts property not having
a phandle. This case would be a bit different because there is not an
analogous property to interrupts.

However, I don't really like connections described via phandles being
done differently for different bindings. And this one has been a bit
unusual.

Perhaps not within the DT, but we could have this case with IOMMUs
within PCIe bus and the PCIe RC itself behind an IOMMU.

I'll reply to Hiroshi's email with more on a variation of his proposal.
