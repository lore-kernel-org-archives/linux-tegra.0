I meant I was hoping that compatible = "google,nyan-big" would be the
catchall not the dtb file name ;-)

Yes I am aware of that. Typically, I have been testing using a FIT image
with single zImage and dtb. Hence no problems.

So are you wanting to create a FIT image to support multiple boards and
use the single FIT image for all? If so then I can see why you want
this. Again please describe the motivation for the changes in the
changelog so it is clear why we are adding this.

Cheers
