From: Alex Van Brunt <avanbrunt@nvidia.com>

Accessed bit is used to age a page and in generic implementation there is
flush_tlb while clearing the accessed bit.
Flushing a TLB is overhead on ARM64 as access flag faults don't get
translation table entries cached into TLB's. Flushing TLB is not necessary
for this. Clearing the accessed bit without flushing TLB doesn't cause data
corruption on ARM64.
In our case with this patch, speed of reading from fast NVMe/SSD through
PCIe got improved by 10% ~ 15% and writing got improved by 20% ~ 40%.
So for performance optimisation don't flush TLB when clearing the accessed
bit on ARM64.
x86 made the same optimization even though their TLB invalidate is much
faster as it doesn't broadcast to other CPUs.
