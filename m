Rob,

The Linux thermal framework makes a sharp distinction between "thermal=20
zones" and "cooling devices". thermal_zones are aware of temperatures=20
and have trip points. cooling_devices are unaware of temperatures --=20
they just have a state variable. The thermal framework binds thermal=20
zones at particular temperatures to particular cooling devices. It does=
=20
so *in software*

The SOC_THERM IP block doesn't fit neatly in that paradigm. Yes, it=20
provides the ability to read temperatures and raise interrupts at=20
temperatures. However, it also has the ability to take cooling action=20
_in hardware_ at particular temperatures. It can throttle the CPU & GPU=
=20
clock and it can shut down the SOC. Neither of those are graceful=20
actions, but they are valuable in practice.

In previous incarnations of this driver we have implemented an unholy=20
mash-up of a cooling device and a thermal zone for configuring the=20
hardware thermal actions. It was a mess. This patchset from Wei takes a=
=20
simpler approach -- allow the thermal hardware cooling actions to be=20
configured directly via DT. It's simple but it's good enough in=20
practice. I like it.
