Yes, this doesn't feel very clever especially in this use case where
we're mostly providing data into the thermal framework and not really
relying on it for anything.

Perhaps we should ensure that at least some glue code is bool rather
than modular?  That's got downsides too, it increases the amount of code
that gets built into the kernel but perhaps that's an acceptable
tradeoff here.
