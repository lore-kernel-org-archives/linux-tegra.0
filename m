OK, will remove those.

OK, will switch to the format you described earlier:

"Must contain '"nvidia,<chip>-pcie", "nvidia,tegra20-pcie"' where
 <chip> is tegra30, tegra132, ..."

OK, will squash.

Is there an example of this in the tree that you have in mind, where 
another document is used for the list?  Would it just contain a list of 
the Tegra chips, e.g., tegra30, tegra114, tegra124, etc?

OK.
