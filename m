Can you please elaborate it a little bit?  I do not quite understand
what you mean.

Basically, imx6q has a low-power mode named WAIT.  When all 4 cores
are in WFI, imx6q will go into WAIT mode, and whenever there is a
wakeup interrupt, it will exit WAIT mode.  Software can configure
hardware behavior during WAIT mode, clock gating or power gating for
ARM core.

I'm trying to implement this low-power mode with coupled cpuidle.
I initially have the following code as the coupled cpuidle enter
function for clock gating case.

static int imx6q_enter_wait_coupled(struct cpuidle_device *dev,
				    struct cpuidle_driver *drv, int index)
{
	int cpu = dev->cpu;

	clockevents_notify(CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_ENTER, &cpu);

	if (atomic_inc_return(&master) == num_online_cpus())
		imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_UNCLOCKED);

	cpu_do_idle();

	if (atomic_dec_return(&master) == num_online_cpus() - 1)
		imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_CLOCKED);

	clockevents_notify(CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_EXIT, &cpu);
	return index;
}

However I think there are a couple of problems.  The first one is the
extra wakeups you have mentioned.  When last cpu is in call
imx6q_set_lpm(), some of the first 3 cpus that are already in WFI may
exit from there.  The second one is when hardware exits WAIT mode and
has ARM clock resumed, some cpus may stay in WFI if scheduler has
nothing to wake them up.  This breaks the requirement of coupled cpuidle
that all cpus need to exit together.  I can force the function to work
around the problems by adding cpuidle_coupled_parallel_barrier() just
above cpu_do_idle() and arch_send_wakeup_ipi_mask(cpu_online_mask)
right after imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_CLOCKED).  But I doubt it's appropriate.

So I rewrite the function as below to not use coupled cpuidle, and it
works fine.

static int imx6q_enter_wait(struct cpuidle_device *dev,
			    struct cpuidle_driver *drv, int index)
{
	int cpu = dev->cpu;

	clockevents_notify(CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_ENTER, &cpu);

	if (atomic_inc_return(&master) == num_online_cpus()) {
		/*
		 * With this lock, we prevent the other cpu to exit and
		 * enter this function again and become the master.
		 */
		if (!spin_trylock(&master_lock))
			goto idle;

		imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_UNCLOCKED);
		cpu_do_idle();
		imx6q_set_lpm(WAIT_CLOCKED);

		spin_unlock(&master_lock);
		goto out;
	}

idle:
	cpu_do_idle();
out:
	atomic_dec(&master);
	clockevents_notify(CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_EXIT, &cpu);
	return index;
}

For power gating case, it may better fit coupled cpuidle usage model,
since all the cores will have to run resume routine and thus will not
be in WFI when hardware exits from WAIT mode.  But we still need to
work out the extra wakeup issue which will also be seen in this case.

Do you have a pointer to the initial discussion for the extension, or
you have a draft patch for that already (hopefully:)?
