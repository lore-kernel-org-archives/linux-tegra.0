By "here" you mean what you are proposing for ordering device
suspends, or on-demand probing?

If you meant that probing on-demand is unneeded if we already have
dependency information, I agree with you and that's why I only pushed
forward on-demand, as the approach linked above introduced some
duplication when inferring the dependencies. Maybe that could be
avoided without too much refactoring.

In any case, Thierry mentioned the other day in #tegra that one could
also collect dependency information as a follow up to the on-demand
series by calling device_depend() or such instead of
of_device_probe().
