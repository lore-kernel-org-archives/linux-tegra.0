Actually, I take that back. This patch breaks stuff: just GPIO stuff which
I didn't test, not IRQ stuff which I did.

This patch changes INT_GPIO_NR from 224 to 256, which in turn changes the
value of TEGRA_NR_GPIOS. This is the number of GPIOs that the Tegra GPIO
controller "assigns" to itself when registering with gpiolib. Now, Tegra
doesn't define ARCH_NR_GPIOs, so it defaults to 256. This means there is
no GPIO numbering space left for non-Tegra GPIO controllers. In particular,
the WM8903 audio codec registers with gpiolib, and one of the GPIOs is used
on most boards to enable/disable the speaker amplifier, which now doesn't
work since the GPIO ID to control it isn't registered.

To solve this, I recommend definining ARCH_NR_GPIOs for Tegra, to something
large; I see that arch/arm/mach-shmobile defines it to 1024. Failing any
disadvantage of using a number that large, I'd go for that...
