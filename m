Something that's kept me wondering is why there actually need to be two
separate regions. Since the extended configuration space is a superset
of the regular configuration space it should be possible to access the
regular registers via the extended configuration space as well.

Stephen: Could you try to find out whether the regular configuration
space translation can just be omitted if we already set up the one for
the extended configuration space? In tegra_pcie_setup_translations(),
BAR 0 is setup for regular configuration space (which requires a 16 MiB
region), while BAR 1 is setup for the extended configuration space
(requiring a full 256 MiB region). However, if I understand correctly,
each of the registers that can be accessed via the BAR 0 translation can
also be accessed via the BAR 1 translation. That seems like we're
wasting the 16 MiB set aside for the BAR 0 mapping.

That's very similar to how things work on Tegra. Configuration space
accesses to the host bridges are done via their respective memory-mapped
register spaces. All other accesses use either the BAR 0 or BAR 1
translations as I described above. These translations however are unique
and only a single set of accessors are provided.

Given that and what I said in the other mail about the implementation of
ECAM on Tegra any CS range we pass to the host bridges via the DT ranges
property is actually wrong.
