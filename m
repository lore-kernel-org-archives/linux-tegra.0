This series only instantiates the SPI controller, and not any SPI
devices. I tried to solve this:

However, this didn't work. Has the driver been tested? I'm seeing the
exact same problems I saw with the old driver, namely that the SPI flash
chip can't be identified; I think the ID bytes are read back as 0, and
hence drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c falls back to identifying the device
as mr25h256. Attempting to hexdump -C /dev/mtd0 gives me 32K of zeros,
whereas the device is 4M and full of non-zero data according to U-Boot.

Do you know what the problem is here? Can you please update the patch
series so that the SPI flash is instantiated and works correctly?
