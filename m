Will split it out.

I have tested the default values with two different chip types, and
both have worked without me adjusting any timings. The tested chips
are SJA1000 (CAN) and 16C550 (UART). So I would say that they are
sensible.

Will split it out as well.

I can understand the confusion.

If we take a look on similar controllers found on others SOCs they
usually define an address range / chip-select.

Example (weim):
ranges = <
0 0 0x10000000 0x02000000
1 0 0x12000000 0x01000000
2 0 0x13000000 0x01000000
3 0 0x14000000 0x01000000
4 0 0x15000000 0x01000000
5 0 0x16000000 0x01000000
>;

Which means that you all ready have an address mapped to PIN function.

But Tegra GMI controller is a first for me, where you do not have this
kind of setup in hardware. Usually you also have a timing register /
chip-select so that you can connect different chip types.

The lack of hardware support do decode an address to a chip-select PIN
function, we have implemented this our self externally.

We actually have 6 different chips connected to the GMI bus and the
"ranges" would be:
  ranges = <
   0 0 0x48000000 0x00000100
   1 0 0x48040000 0x00000100
   2 0 0x48080000 0x00000100
   3 0 0x480A0000 0x00000100
   4 0 0x480C0000 0x00000100
   5 0 0x480E0000 0x00000100
  >;

And this not nothing complicated, small number of AND gates and that is it.

The chip-select signal is necessary for the access characteristics, so
we need to translate an address to an chip-select so that the chip
knows the host CPU wants to talk to it.

Do not know if I made anything more clear here :).

This is only setup at probe.

Yes, ultimately you would need some sort of infrastructure to allow
devices to acquire the GMI bus if you want to solve this in software.
But at the moment I do not see such an infrastructure in place, and is
it feasible to add one specifically for the GMI controller? If one
such infrastructure was in place we would need to modify all the
drivers that want to use to include Tegra specific infrastructure to
access the GMI bus?

Since my knowledge is limited it hard for me to comment on this, maybe
there is a simple way of doing this?
