I don't have a good answer for this unfortunately. I wouldn't want relative
include paths to take over because they can paper over a lot of other
problems when people get lazy.

It looks ok to me in principle, but you could also solve this by making
DEBUG_TEGRA_UART a silent option like this:

I don't have a strong preference either way.
