It's a small hierarchy violation, but I expect that it would work in 
practice.

To the extent that the device tree is the definitive answer about the 
system addressing, if you get it wrong, either the system will not work 
or the OS isn't paying attention to that part of the device tree, 
hardcoding the right answer.
