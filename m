If you need to fill in the values in that struct dynamically anyway, why
not make tegra_lp1_iram be a struct rather than a pointer, and write
directly to it?

That said, aren't tegra30_iram_start constants that the linker can work
out, so I think you can just initialize the structure at compile-time,
and save some code.

Is there a need to have separate iram_hook()/sleep_core_init()
functions? Perhaps they can be combined into a single function for
simplicity.

It'd be nice to be consistent re: whether we define dummy static
inlines, or use IS_ENABLED() at the call-site. IIRC, there's lots of use
of IS_ENABLED() in the Tegra PM code now, so perhaps these patches
should use that instead?

Doesn't this wait any amount of time from 0..1uS, and hence it actually
/isn't/ very exact?

Parameter "rn" could be renamed to make its purpose clear from the name.
How about target_us or wait_until_this_time? "wait_until" is also rather
a generic name; wait_until_us would be much better, which would require
renaming wait_until_us above, which I think might be better deleted, or
renamed to wait_until_next_us?

What does "AND MUST BE FIRST" mean?

Some #defines for the various magic values used in this code would be
useful.

This might be simpler, and easier to validate it's the right length:

        .rept   8
        .long   0
        .endr

Perhaps if you swapp the order of declaring tegra30_sdram_pad_save and
tegra30_sdram_pad_address, you can even do something like:

	.rept (tegra30_sdram_pad_addr_end - tegra30_sdram_pad_addr) / 4

?

jumping sounds like a CPU program counter operation.
s/jumping/switching/ ?

Ah, I see how wait_for_us is used now. Perhaps rename it
wait_for_us_boundary or wait_for_us_tick? Alternatively, perhaps
wait_until can just incorporate that logic itself?
