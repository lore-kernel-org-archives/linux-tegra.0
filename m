I got no response after my last suggestion to add it below the corresponding 
usb controller [1]. It wasn't a clever idea anyway I think. So the best 
solution would be as Olof suggested to add it as a platform_device. See my 
original patch [2]. If this is ok, I can send a rebased version, and hope that 
the DT people accept it.

Some other things regarding board removal also came into my mind. First, is 
the sdhci order problem solved? Maybe I missed it, but it would be nice if we 
could give the internal emmc a device number of zero and the external reader a 
device number one. Currently it is oposite around and AFAIK device tree 
guaranties no special order unless you enforce it somehow.

Another (maybe a bit off-topic) thing that puzzels me is the how to assign the 
clock to the nvec. The device needs the clock (tegra-i2c.2) but there is no 
sane way to get it. I was thinking to add an device name alias (nvec = tegra-
i2c.2) to the board file so I can use clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL) instead of 
clk_get_sys which seems to be unwanted. Is it possible to add a "clock" 
property to it?

Otherwise I'm fine with board file removal.
