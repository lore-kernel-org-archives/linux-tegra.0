Sorry, haven't been looking at this older for a while so this reply is
high-latency.

If you want to do a separate dt-bindings branch that includes the headers and
is present in both the dt and drivers branch, that'd work. If the changes are
trivial though, and just contains a few clocks, I think we should just have
them opencoded on the original merge, and then move over once the include files
have gone in. I'd be willing to merge such conversions between -rc1 and -rc2.

That's in particular the case when there's an external driver tree/maintainer,
since it avoids the three-way handshake, etc.
