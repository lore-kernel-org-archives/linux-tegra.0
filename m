I don't think there's any obstacle to having this as a devfreq driver,
it's just that it won't use much/any functionality of it so I don't
really see the point.

I think it will be better if I send a version of the driver that uses
the devfreq framework, so we can better compare (and maybe I will
change my opinion).
