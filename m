From: Stefan Agner <stefan@agner.ch>

By using the SD/MMC host device ID as a starting point for block
device numbering, one can reliably predict the first block device
name (at least for the first controller). This is especially useful
for SoCs with multiple SD/MMC host controller, where the controller
with index 0 is connected to a eMMC device.

Usually the first controller gets the first block device name ID,
however this is not guaranteed. Also if the first controller is
aliased as second controller and visa-versa (using device tree
aliases), the block device name ID assignation is not ordered by
the SD/MMC host device ID (since mmc_rescan is called in order of
the memory mapped pheripherial addresses).
