How odd. The problems were indeed solved by using the downstream
debounce/... timings. It's odd that using a shorter debounce time leads
to /not/ generating spurious keypress events; perhaps the HW is buggy
for the extremely large debounce value that you chose.

I also noticed that one entry in the keymap had a typo.

Can you please roll the patch below into yours:
