I agree that as an isolated change there isn't a clear benefit.
However in the context of the series the change is needed to
avoid resuming a load monitor that wasn't even started.

In case this series isn't accepted I'd still suggest to change the
name from 'stop_polling' to 'suspended'. I read 'stop_polling' as a
call for action, while 'suspended' is a state. IMO at least in some
contexts conditions using a state is clearer.

Cheers

Matthias
