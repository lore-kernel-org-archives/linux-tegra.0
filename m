I guess the smallest possible change would be to add a 
#hardware-trip-cells property to the thermal driver node (this would 
need to designate both the thermal zone and the trip point) and a 
hardware-trip-point phandle node to trip points. Then trip points could 
point to a hardware trip point that would get programmed. Since this is 
just adding properties, it would be backwards-compatible as well.
This is starting to sound like a good idea. Will have to give think 
about it some more.
