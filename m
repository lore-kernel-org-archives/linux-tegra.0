I came up with the following alternative:

	pci {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-pcie";
		reg =3D <0x80003000 0x00000800   /* PADS registers */
		       0x80003800 0x00000200   /* AFI registers */
		       0x80004000 0x00100000   /* configuration space */
		       0x80104000 0x00100000   /* extended configuration space */
		       0x80400000 0x00010000   /* downstream I/O */
		       0x90000000 0x10000000   /* non-prefetchable memory */
		       0xa0000000 0x10000000>; /* prefetchable memory */
		interrupts =3D <0 98 0x04   /* controller interrupt */
		              0 99 0x04>; /* MSI interrupt */
		status =3D "disabled";

		ranges =3D <0x80000000 0x80000000 0x00002000   /* 2 root ports */
			  0x80004000 0x80004000 0x00100000   /* configuration space */
			  0x80104000 0x80104000 0x00100000   /* extended configuration space */
			  0x80400000 0x80400000 0x00010000   /* downstream I/O */
			  0x90000000 0x90000000 0x10000000   /* non-prefetchable memory */
			  0xa0000000 0xa0000000 0x10000000>; /* prefetchable memory */

		#address-cells =3D <1>;
		#size-cells =3D <1>;

		port@80000000 {
			reg =3D <0x80000000 0x00001000>;
			status =3D "disabled";
		};

		port@80001000 {
			reg =3D <0x80001000 0x00001000>;
			status =3D "disabled";
		};
	};

The "ranges" property can probably be cleaned up a bit, but the most
interesting part is the port@ children, which can simply be enabled in board
DTS files by setting the status property to "okay". I find that somewhat mo=
re
intuitive to the variant with an "enable-ports" property.

What do you think of this?
