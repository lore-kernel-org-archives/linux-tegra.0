I vaguely recall asking for the DMA support to be integrated into the 
regular 8250 driver instead when the separate DMA-capable driver was 
first added. I /think/ there was resistance to this because adding lots 
of different SoC-specific ways to do DMA into the existing 8250 driver 
would complicate it even more, and hence be unmaintainable.

I assume that reasoning is still valid.

Perhaps what we need is more fine-grained driver selection, not just 
based on compatible value. Something like:

if compatible == nvidia,tegra20-uart:
   if node.has_prop("enable-dma"):
     driver = Tegra-specfic DMA capable UART driver
   else:
     driver = Common 8250 driver

Is that something that of_serial.c could/should be enhanced to do? That 
said, the whole reasoning behind separate compatible properties before 
was that compatible is supposed to "drive" driver selection. At least, 
that's what I was told then.

I believe either the serial core or serial driver(s) support DT aliases 
now, yes.

I do not know.
