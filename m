Right I don't have a Tegra114 board to test with.

I already know that Tegra30 needs some more fixes to get UHS-I to work
and I have patches for that, but they are not yet ready for sending
out. I would guess that Tegra114 may need the same fix as Tegra30. I
can Cc you on those patches if you prefer.

Please submit a formal patch to disable UHS-I on Tegra114, I think it's
the right thing to do at this point and will happily ACK it.

Regards,
Lucas
