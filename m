R1B is the same as R1 but with _optional_ busy detection on DAT0. So I
don't think we will be violating the spec by only using CMD13.

I have started to craft to together a patch for how __mmc_switch()
would be changed in this respect.

I don't think it will become that complicated, and more importantly -
for the ERASE commands, it will be simplifier since there are not the
special case were CMD13 is _not_ allowed, which is the case for
SWITCH.

I suggest we should move away from using max_discard_to to calculate
max_discard. This just don't work smoothly since we can end up in
cases were we get too few blocks or not any at all. Like what happen
for Stephen in the Tegra case.

I would prefer if we could select a fixed number of max
blocks/eraseblocks, then calculate the timeout based on that.

So maybe the fixed numer of max blocks/eraseblocks should be just a few ones?
