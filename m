From the bootlog I see ...

This shows the xusb controller is runtime resumed during probe but
then after probe the pm-domains, xusba and xusbc, are turned off
without it being runtime suspended. We never suspend it until it
is removed currently. 

Following boot the xusb device appears to still be active ... 

$ cat /sys/devices/platform/70090000.usb/power/runtime_status 
active

... but the status reported by the pm_genpd summary disagrees ...

$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/pm_genpd_summary
domain                          status          slaves

Let me know if you have any thoughts.
