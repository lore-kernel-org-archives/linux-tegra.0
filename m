Sorry for the delay.

We do, however, support the nesting of power-domains to allow more than
one power-domain to be controlled for a device. For the current
implementations that use nested power-domains, I am not sure if the
power-domains are truly nested or just describing a relationship between
power-domains.

Nesting power-domains could also work for the Tegra XHCI device.
However, I don't wish to statically nest the power-domains in
device-tree where they are defined so they are always nested, because
this may not be always necessary. However, I would rather the client of
the power-domains specify which power-domains they require and
dynamically nested the power-domains at runtime. This is slightly
different to what I proposed in this RFC, but it is not really beyond
the bounds of what we support today IMO. What is missing is a means to
do this dynamically and not statically.

By the way, I am not sure if you are suggesting that for devices that
may need multiple power-domains we should architect the driver
differently and split it up in some way such that we have a power-domain
per device. But for the case of the Tegra XHCI it is quite complex
because the driver loads firmware which runs on a micro-controller and
we need to manage the various power-domains that are used.
