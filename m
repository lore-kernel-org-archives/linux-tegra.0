From a control point of view that's always the case for DPI panels (as those 
panels have no control bus, the backlight control bus is by definition 
separate) and is the case for the two DBI panels I've seen (but I won't claim 
that's a significative number of panels).

When you write "sending commands to the panel", do you mean on the same 
control bus that the panel use ? Or would that also include for instance an 
I2C backlight controller integrated inside a DSI panel module ? In the later 
case there might still be dependencies between the panel controller and the 
backlight controller (let's say for instance that the panel controller has a 
DSI-controller GPIO wired to the backlight controller reset signal), but in 
practice I don't know if that's ever the case.

That makes sense. Unless I'm mistaken a backlight is always associated with a 
panel (it would be called a light if there was no panel in front of it). We 
can thus expose backlight operations in the panel CDF (in-kernel) API. The 
panel driver would need a way to retrieve a pointer to the associated 
backlight device.

If we decide to make the panel expose backlight operations we could get rid of 
the backlight device in this case.

I'm fine with that, but using the CDF would be even better :-)
