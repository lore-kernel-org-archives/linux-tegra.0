They do not.  ChromeOS kernels just parse the EDID, so I suppose we'll
need something similar here to support the HD panel.

Only the panel is different.

The system will enter recovery mode (and thus won't boot) unless you
do an EC reset.  Refresh and power are keys on the keyboard.

The convention for other Chromebooks so far (see
exynos5420-peach-pit.dts for example) has just been to include the
Google board name.

Nyan is the name for our Tegra124 reference platform.  Big is derived
from this and there are other variants of Nyan other than Big.

There is a debug connector on the board which provides the serial
lines.  It is similar to Venice2, but in a different form factor.

Tegra SoCs are normally reset via the PMC, however that does not reset
any external peripherals.  In order to reset the TPM at the same time
as the SoC, the GPIO I5 must be driven low.  Something like the
gpio-poweroff driver, but instead for restart could be used to do
this.

It does, but it's not specific to sbs-battery.  All power supplies
have an optional power-supplies property, see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power_supply/power_supply.txt.
