WiFi and SPI now work on both Tegra20/30.

PCIe still doesn't work on Tegra20. The reason is that
clk_plle_enable()'s call to _get_table_rate() fails, since
pll->fixed_rate is 0, and hence there's no matching table entry.

I simply commented out that call, and the later code that uses its
results to configure the PLL rate, and then everything worked - or at
least PCIe device enumeration and hence lspci worked, which is as much
as works right now with PCIe on Tegra...

Is the solution here to fix clk-tegra20.c's call to tegra_clk_plle() to
specify a valid fixed rate?

However, I'm puzzled why clk_plle_enable() is even touching the dividers
though; shouldn't clk_plle_set_rate() be setting up the rate, and
clk_plle_enable() /just/ be enabling/disabling the PLL? The old clock
driver appears to work the way I expect, and use the standard PLL
set_rate op for this clock, and has a very simple custom enable op for PLLe.

The remaining item is the display issue on Tegra30, which I'll go look
at now.
