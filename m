Yes, a delay of 0 disables polling in the thermal core. (The hw trip 
code doesn't do anything with it) One way to fix this would be to export 
a rate changing function in the thermal core and have of-thermal set the 
polling rate to 0 or the value from device tree depending on if hw trip 
point programming succeeded or not. This would also be good for error 
handling, since if hw trip poing programming failed for whatever reason, 
we could still fall back to polling.

The reasoning was that #thermal-sensor-cells as a cells-property is a 
bit different from the rest, so separate them. But I can remove the 
blank line just as well.
