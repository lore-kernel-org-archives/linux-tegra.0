Stephen,
Sorry, I missed your comment to reply.
I mean was that compatible should be
compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-uart",   "nvidia,tegra20-uart";
compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-hsuart", "nvidia,tegra30-hsuart";

not

compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-uart",   "nvidia,tegra20-uart";
compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-hsuart", "nvidia,tegra20-hsuart";


The reason is that, tegra30 has the clock divider in the CAR register 
set and it is 15.1 which gives more precise baudrate. tegra20 does not 
have the same.
Tegra114 also have the clock divider in the CAR register.

All SoCs UART support 16.0 clock divider inside the uart controller as 
DLL/DLM.

Simple uart driver use the uart clock divider and it is fine here.

High speed uart driver uses the car register driver for better 
flexibility and better resolution.
