So how does an algorithm figure this out in both my examples? The
algorithm would have to know about both (all) bus masters and their
stream IDs for a specific SMMU. If the algorithm operates on the set of
stream IDs for one bus master at a time the algorithm has no way of
knowing which bits can be ignored since it doesn't know the value of the
other stream IDs for the other bus masters and thus could potentially
create a mask that could cause a stream ID to match in two different
entries.

Unless I am mistaken the algorithm works on one bus master at a time. I
don't think that will work.
