Hmm. And here I was thinking that I was basing branches on top of
each-other too much given your previous comments about merge conflicts
being OK!

In case it helps, the following commit in linux-next shows the conflict
resolution:

ee05948 Merge branch 'for-3.9/scu-base-rework' into for-3.9/soc-t114

I guess I missed this because I didn't merge for-3.9/scu-base-rework
into my for-next on its own, but only as part of for-3.9/soc-t114,
within which I had resolved the conflict as above.

So, you could just skip this pull request, and it'll be pulled in when
you merge for-3.9/soc-t114.

It that doesn't work for you, I can do the rebase tomorrow morning.
