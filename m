Adding Vinod here.

I looked the dma devicetree bingind document and did not found the 
generic binding name. Howvere, for arm-pl330.txt, it is explained as
Example:

         pdma0: pdma@12680000 {
                 compatible = "arm,pl330", "arm,primecell";
                 reg = <0x12680000 0x1000>;
                 interrupts = <99>;
         };

Client drivers (device nodes requiring dma transfers from dev-to-mem or
mem-to-dev) should specify the DMA channel numbers using a two-value pair
as shown below.

   [property name]  = <[phandle of the dma controller] [dma request id]>;

       where 'dma request id' is the dma request number which is connected
       to the client controller. The 'property name' is recommended to be
       of the form <name>-dma-channel.

   Example:  tx-dma-channel = <&pdma0 12>;


So here I can also add the name like same.

Vinod,
Do you see any issue in follow the above mechanism for Tegra dma client 
driver?

Thanks,
Laxman
