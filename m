So looking at a few Tegra TRMs, I see comments to the effect ...

'In DDR50 mode, SD clock divisor should always be 2'

... which aligns with the above statement and your comment.

Yes I guess my concern is that we end up running at a rate much less than
expected. I am not sure if it is worth warning against this or not.

Agree.

Thanks for the explanation. Looks good to me ...
