I don't understand this last bit about the number of devices attached
to the host bridges.  Logically, the host bridge has a bus number
aperture that you can know up front, even before you know anything
about what devices are below it.  On x86, for example, the ACPI _CRS
method has something like "[bus 00-7f]" in it, which means that any
buses in that range are below this bridge.  That doesn't tell us
anything about which buses actually have devices on them, of course;
it's just analogous to the secondary and subordinate bus number
registers in a P2P bridge.
