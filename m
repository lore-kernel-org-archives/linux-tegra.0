Looking at the keymap you posted, you define 62 keys and 16 function
keys. So if that is all you care about on your particular keyboard,
that means that the layout with the 1-cell format is 248 bytes for the
base keymap, and 64 bytes for the fn-keymap. The benefit of using the
row/column/keycode format is that the table is only as large as the
number of keys you care about.

You keep saying "direct ASCII", but your map contains non-ASCII
characters. ASCII provides no way at all to specify things such as shif=
t,
or arrow keys, or other common new keys on keyboards. Instead you have =
had to
make up an ad-hoc custom map that contains your own special codes for t=
hese
keys.

=46or example, for arrow keys you seem to overload the FS/GS/RS/US. I'm=
 not
saying we expect to need to use those ascii codes, but it does seem arb=
itrary
to just grab them for arrow keys. So in essence you have come up with y=
our own
encoding of non-ASCII keys instead of reusing what is already available=
 through
the linux keycodes.

Also, for example with return, does it encode as CR, LF or CR+LF? Etc.

Doing a binding in pseudo-ASCII is just asking for extra complications,=
 in my
opinion. Over time that encoding is likely to swell to similar sizes an=
yway,
but still be incompatible.

I had included the row/column property in my binding for KEY_FN, but in
hindsight it's probably just enough to decode that through the regular =
key
layout, since there will be an entry for it there.

It doesn't make sense to come up with a fresh, brand new binding that
requires anyone adding a new device to it to do extra work to do two
redunant descriptions of the same device. We should be able to find com=
mon
ground.

The KEY_* codes that are interesting all seem to be in the range of
0-83. In the u-boot case, that means the base KEY*-to-ascii table would
be 83 bytes.

That means that the memory consumption for your case above would be
4*62+4*16=3D312 bytes for the base+fn table, and then 3*83 =3D 249 byte=
s
for the KEY*-to-ASCII tables for regular/shift/ctrl, for a total of
561 bytes. I'm sure there will be a few special cases in the code just
like you have now for arrow keys, etc, but they don't have to be in the
83-byte table.

Sure, that is somewhat more than your 4*128 byte tables, but it is also
a much more flexible binding that is less likely to hit limitations dow=
n
the road.

I think it's a great idea to use a common binding, since there will jus=
t be
wasted effort for vendors to have to create two maps and keep them in s=
ync.
