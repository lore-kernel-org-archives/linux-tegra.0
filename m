Oh, and before you ask why I'm now doing it, it's through necessity.  I've
had too many instances where some maintainers will take patches sent out
as part of a RFC without being asked to do so - and I've then had to email
the maintainers asking them to drop such patches from their trees.

I wish this kind of buggeration of patches wasn't necessary, but
unfortunately - as seems to always be the case - people just can't be
trusted to pay due care and attention, and do the right thing.

That's why the intention is to (a) prevent the patch being applied without
thought while (b) allowing it to be applied with a trivial transformation.

FTTC broadband for 0.8mile line: 5.8Mbps down 500kbps up.  Estimation
in database were 13.1 to 19Mbit for a good line, about 7.5+ for a bad.
Estimate before purchase was "up to 13.2Mbit".
