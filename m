Stephen,

I was already wondering here, if I should separate the patches into 
preparation and actual removal. I put that question into the cover
letter and removed it from this patch text ;)

As you suggest to use preparation/removal, I will take that approach
for the final patch set. Will take you original unmodified patch then.

Sebastian
