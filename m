Yes, patch 11/31 introduced this.

I think I can make a "core changes" branch that contains:

[PATCH 11/31] dma: add channel request API that supports deferred probe

[PATCH 14/31] ASoC: dmaengine: support deferred probe for DMA channels

[PATCH 15/31] ASoC: dmaengine: add custom DMA config to
snd_dmaengine_pcm_config

That could be merged into relevant subsystems alone, if they only depend
on the core changes and not any of the Tegra driver changes.

However, I suspect that the Tegra driver changes may need to be merged
into any subsystem that's doing much other work on the Tegra drivers,
especially any significant refactoring, so the subsystem would probably
have to pick up the whole series anyway. Still, I'll make sure I
re-order the branch to put the core changes first so we have as much
flexibility as possible.
