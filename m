yes, proper rfkill support is on my ToDo list. As it seems, the rt2x00 driver 
which we are using also has some initial support for gpio based rfkill. I guess 
I need some more time to sort this out.

There are surely better ways to do this. Luckily, we got some more time to 
rework this because the tegra board changes were put to "hold" status. Expect 
some new version in a few weeks.

Colin, first sorry that I misspelled your name serveral times. I swear it will 
not happen again. 

Second, please don't apply this patch to the for-next tree. I will resend a new 
version which better integrates into the kernel subsystem.

Thanks for your comments!

Marc
