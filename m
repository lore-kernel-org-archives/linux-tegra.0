I tried using polling in the mailbox framework. Some printing is done 
from atomic context so it seems tx_block cannot be used - 
wait_for_completion_timeout understandably does not work in atomic 
context. I also tried without tx_block, in which case I got some 
horribly garbled output, but "Try increasing MBOX_TX_QUEUE_LEN" was 
readable there.

Any opinions?

Thanks,
Mikko
