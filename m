First one I am fine with. Second is more chip specific goop where we
don't want it. However right at the moment there isn't a magic cure to
that and the port->ops hackery I've been doing isn't done and it's not
reasonable to hold this up waiting for a project with indeterminate
completion date.

Ack #1

Can you add a 

/*
 * FIXME: This needs to become a port specific callback once we have a
 * framework for this
 */

to #2 so it doesn't get forgotten in a future cleanup.
