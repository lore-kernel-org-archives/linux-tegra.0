Very interesting, I was not aware of this.

Yes, so this will not work here as-is, because the pmc->dev is common to
all pm-domains (it is the device that creates all the pm-domains). So to
make this work, I would need to create a device for each pm-domain and
add the clocks to that.

I see that this works very well for normal drivers, but it does not feel
so natural for pm-domains where we don't have a device struct today. By
the way, the rockchip pm-domains implementation is very much in the same
boat as tegra, where there are multiple clocks per pm-domain and it is
handled by a simple list. So I am not sure if you think that we should
be turning all pm-domains registered by pm_genpd_init() into a device
and then we can make use of these pm_clk_XXXX() APIs?

I have implemented the generic clk APIs that Ulf and I discussed for
handling multiple clocks, but if we think that this is a better way,
then I will hold off for now.

Cheers
Jon
