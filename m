Panda has the exact same USB hub configuration, and is affected. So we
can rule this out.

I just noticed something else. Harmony is fast *most of the time*. In
about one in 3 reboots, I get the slow behavior. When USB is fast, I
also have I2C interrupts "screaming":

 85:     294321          0       GIC  tegra-i2c
116:          0          0       GIC  tegra-i2c
118:      98542          0       GIC  tps6586x

This is a couple of seconds after boot.

When USB is slow, I see the following:
[    0.385270] tps6586x 3-0034: Chip ID read failed: -121
[    0.390584] tps6586x: probe of 3-0034 failed with error -5

... and I2C interrupt is quiet.

The I2C interrupt handler calls writel(), which does a cache sync. That
would explain the "fast" behavior of Harmony.

Do you see the same this on your board?
