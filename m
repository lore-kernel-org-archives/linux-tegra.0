Changelog:

v3: Addressed all review comments that were made by Chanwoo Choi to v2.

    Patch "Synchronize IRQ after masking it in hardware" morphed into
    "Properly disable interrupts", which disables interrupts more solidly.

    Added new minor patch: "Rename tegra-devfreq.c to tegra30-devfreq.c".

    Added missed error handlings for dev_pm_opp_add().

v2: The patchset was quite heavily reworked since v1, few patches we
    dropped or squashed into the new ones and more patches we added.
    In a result more bugs and potential problems are fixed now, driver's
    code got more clean up.

    The Tegra20 driver-addition patch is now a part of this series, it has
    no changes since v1.
