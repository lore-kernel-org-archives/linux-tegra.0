This looks much better than the Samsung binding and the original 3-cell=
 one.

U-Boot Tegra (keyboard patch series) currently uses a 16x8 matrix, and
uses a single byte (the ASCII character) for a total of 128 bytes per
keymap. Since U-Boot does not have (or apparently want) the concept of
key codes or the added code and intermediate data this requires, the
binding presented here will not suit U-Boot so far.

These rows and columns embedded in the cell make it more of a pain to
write the fdt description. If you just set up the cells in (column,
row) order and set the matrix size (rows, columns) then you end up
with 128 entries on Tegra. If you use uint16 then this could be 256
bytes instead of 512. The binding you present for Tegra would be 109 *
4 =3D 436 bytes. However I take your point that Fn maps are much more
sparse, so overall this is likely to be similar (512 bytes for either
method once Fn mappings are taken into account).

But going back to U-Boot, it does not have the intermediate table that
you malloc and decant into, it does not understand key codes so
doesn't know what to do when Shift is pressed, doesn't understand
languages, etc. In order to use these Linux bindings in U-Boot we
would need to add new input layer, extra decode code and intermediate
tables. I can almost hear the NAKs already (bear in mind fdt only went
into U-Boot in the December release and people are more sensitive to
code size / performance there than in Linux). I did ask about this on
this list a few weeks ago but no response yet.

We could perhaps add an alternative direct ASCII binding like this
example (which would have to be in a separate node):

                /* Use a packed binding which doesn't include
row,column numbers in each cell */
                packed-binding;
                matrix-columns =3D <8>;
                matrix-rows =3D <16>;
                ascii-binding;  /* ASCII characters instead of keycodes=
 */
		u-boot,keymap  =3D /size/ 8 <00  00  'w' 's' 'a' 'z' 00  DE
				    00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00

				    '5' '4' 'r' 'e' 'f' 'd' 'x' 00
				    '7' '6' 't' 'h' 'g' 'v' 'c' ' '
				    '9' '8' 'u' 'y' 'j' 'n' 'b' 5C
				    '-' '0' 'o' 'i' 'l' 'k' ',' 'm'

				    00  00  00  00  DF  DF  00  00
				    00  00  00  00  00  DC  00  DD
				    00  00  00  00  00  00  00  00
				    '[' 'p' 27  ';' '/' '.' 00  00

				    00  00  00  'q' 00  00  '1' 00
				    1B  '`' 00  09  00  00  00  00>;
		u-boot,keymap-DF =3D /size/ 8 <00  00  'W' 'S' 'A' 'Z' 00  00

=2E..

The DC-DF codes codes denote Shift, Fn and Ctrl keys which would need
a separate keymap - although we could probably calculate the Ctrl one.

=46rom a point of view of efficiency, drivers can simply keep a pointer
to the appropriate property and read out the codes based on
(row,column) position.

If we have something like this, then in order for the keyboard to work
in U-Boot, vendors would need to create a completely separate ASCII
mapping. Yes I agree this is a bit of a pain, but the above map is
fairly easy to type in, and quite compact.

Given the push-back on the U-Boot list from Linux people about my
bindings, I would like to work out the U-Boot side in this thread if
possible, since it seems to be dependent on what Linux does. But I
hope what is created is efficient enough not to bloat U-Boot or
require an new input layer to be added just to use fdt.

Simon
