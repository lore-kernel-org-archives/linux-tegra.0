Yes, I knew this. But everything works as expected, the IRQ storm
disappears and the IRQ of Palmas RTC is working and can be used as a
wake up signal.

Actually I fixed this issue two months ago, I had tried to use 0x0 as
the IRQ flag before. It's not working. But I still tried it today, it's
OK now(!!!). The function is what I expect. Maybe something wrong in my
test two months ago. Will fix this in V2.

This can avoid IRQ storm but introduce a new issue. The system suspend
would be woken up automatically by Palmas RTC all the time.

Thanks,
