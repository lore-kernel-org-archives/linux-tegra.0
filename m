I don't think so. I think it's better that we only have one entry for
getting video modes. Since CDF already provides ".get_modes" for us, we
can rely on that. And according to my understanding, get video modes in
panel driver makes sense than getting it in crtc.

In this way, panel driver may get video modes from EDID or from
hard-coded display timing infos, but other modules such as crtc don't
need to care about that.
