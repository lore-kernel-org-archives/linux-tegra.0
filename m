Actually, there are a lot of peripherals behind the GART. But yes, probably we
would use it exclusively for the GPU allocations.

In a case of the GPU allocations there could be a bug in the allocation code
(drm_mm_scan) that would cause re-mapping of the already mapped pages, we would
be able to catch such a bug.
