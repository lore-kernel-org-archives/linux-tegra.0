This is the correct behaviour.

CPU will fail to boot if it tries to apply erratas via accessing the secure 
registers. I've changed the reset handler to skip erratas on T20/30 if trusted 
foundations present, see "Don't apply CPU erratas in insecure mode" patch. 
This is an intentional change.

Secondary cores are dying in the reset handler in a case of disabled L2 + 
disabled TF. Looks like there is something wrong in regards to stopping 
secondary CPU cores / flushing CPU caches, the suspend-resume isn't working 
right now because of it and likely that kexec is suffering from the same 
issue.

Thanks for testing!
