Colin, can you comment on this?

My rationale here is that the CPU boots straight into the
correct mode -- if there is any boot code before we get here,
then it should already have established the correct mode, otherwise
we're likely to get problems which "MSR" by itself isn't going to
fix -- such as stray interrupts for example.

If that feels unsafe however, we should still to be able to write

	cpsid	aif, #SVC_MODE

(which is the compact v6/v7-compatible way to set all the interrupt
mask bits and get into a specific mode)

Cheers
