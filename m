That sounds very odd. If the main driver hard-codes the list of children
it expects, there's no point using compatible for the children. Using a
bus-structure and compatible values would only be appropriate when the
top-level driver is generic, and simply scans all its children as a
generic bus, without having any idea what's there.

But that's changing the DT bindings. That shouldn't be done.
