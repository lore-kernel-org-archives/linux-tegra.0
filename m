DEBUG_UNCOMPRESS was previously disallowed for Tegra due to tegra.S's
use of global data that was not linked into the decompressor. Solve this
by declaring this symbol in tegra.S when it is being built into the
decompressor. For the kernel proper, leave the declaration in
mach-tegra/common.c as explained in the comment.

+ * In the kernel proper, this data is located in arch/arm/mach-tegra/common.c.
+ * That's because this header is included from multiple files, and we only
+ * want a single copy of the data. In particular, the UART probing code above
+ * assumes it's running using physical addresses. This is true when this file

+ * to share the probe results between the two copies, rather than having
+ * to re-run the probing again later.
+ *
+ * In the decompressor, we put the symbol/storage right here, since common.c
+ * isn't included in the decompressor build. This symbol gets put in .text
+ * even though it's really data, since .data is discarded from the
+ * decompressor. Luckily, .text is writeable in the decompressor!
