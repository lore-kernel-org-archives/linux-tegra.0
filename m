It is actually documented:
include/linux/pinctrl/pinctrl-state.h

/*
 * Standard pin control state definitions
 */

/**
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_DEFAULT: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put
 *      into as default, usually this means the pins are up and ready to
 *      be used by the device driver. This state is commonly used by
 *      hogs to configure muxing and pins at boot, and also as a state
 *      to go into when returning from sleep and idle in
 *      .pm_runtime_resume() or ordinary .resume() for example.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_INIT: normally the pinctrl will be set to "default"
 *      before the driver's probe() function is called.  There are some
 *      drivers where that is not appropriate becausing doing so would
 *      glitch the pins.  In those cases you can add an "init" pinctrl
 *      which is the state of the pins before drive probe.  After probe
 *      if the pins are still in "init" state they'll be moved to
 *      "default".
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_IDLE: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *      when the pins are idle. This is a state where the system is relaxed
 *      but not fully sleeping - some power may be on but clocks gated for
 *      example. Could typically be set from a pm_runtime_suspend() or
 *      pm_runtime_idle() operation.
 * @PINCTRL_STATE_SLEEP: the state the pinctrl handle shall be put into
 *      when the pins are sleeping. This is a state where the system is in
 *      its lowest sleep state. Could typically be set from an
 *      ordinary .suspend() function.
