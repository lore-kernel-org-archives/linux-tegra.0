For all patches I have been Cc'ed to, NAK.

I don't see the advantages now since all known hardware uses the single bit to
describe direction (even for Intel where we have separate gating for in and out
buffers the direction we basically rely on the bit that enables out buffer).

So, that said the direction is always 1 bit and basically 0/1 value. Which one
is in and which one is out just a matter of an agreement we did.

I would also like to see bloat-o-meter statistics before and after your patch.
My guts tell me that the result will be not in the favour of yours solution.
