Indeed, but may not need to be taken care for every SoC. It's depend on
HW design. Different SoC had different design about it. For ex, some SoC
only put CPU core to power saving mode not include GIC, or there is
another irq controller can handle the case when CPU go into power saving
mode. Differenc SoC had different usage here (some need to check all
pending irq, some need to check SGI only and some even no need to
consider this). So putting this into to common code may not a good
choice.
