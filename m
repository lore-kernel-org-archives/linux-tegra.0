No, I definitely don't agree here. The rules for arch/arm64 are: no
platform-specific code. We should immediately start planning for that.
If this means renaming the file that creates the virtual device from
tegra-cpufreq.c to something else, so be it, but we shouldn't go
backwards and push stuff into the arch directories.
