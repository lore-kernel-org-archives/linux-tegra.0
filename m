As far as the board goes, WF_EN is just a GPIO signal to the WiFi card;
it doesn't gate power to the card. If it gates power inside the card,
that's an internal implementation detail of the card, and something I'd
be fine with the driver knowing directly, and hence I'm OK with
representing this as a GPIO rather than a regulator - that's what it is
externally to the WiFi device.

(BTW everyone, many of the emails in this thread are awfully formatted -
top-posted and not word-wrapped. It's very hard to read them... I tried
to reformat everything and fix it in this email)
