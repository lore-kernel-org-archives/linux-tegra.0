Sorry Master, but you really don't need to spend so much time typing the
same things three times  - I understand what are you trying to do :(

I did my comments with assumption that it's not officially prohibited/deprecated
to register drivers (and execute probes) from late_initcall() layer
(just recommended) and there are still bunch of drivers which are doing this.
Now I see that it's not a recommendation any more, and deferred_probe_initcall()
might be a good place to activate driver_deferred_probe_report if goal is to
identify and fix such drivers.

Sorry for your time.

Also, I've spend some time today testing your proposal - hope you'll find results
useful.

I've applied truncated version of your patch (diff below) on TI's 4.1 kernel and
run few tests (log is below) on dra7-evm/am43xx-gpevm - K4.1 is not far away from LKML,
so I assume this test is valid. Overall boot process consists from two stages:
kernel boot and modules loading. 

My Changes:
 - only really_probe() modified to show deferred device/drivers 

From the log I can see additional messages in log when modules are loading,
because driver_deferred_probe_report is still true - dwc3 probes were deferred,
but then finally succeeded.

So, as you've mentioned, it seems a good thing to deactivate driver_deferred_probe_report and
provide user with ability to turn it on again (and probably re-trigger deferred
device probing).

I've found no issues during Kernel boot (built-in) time, new messages are displayed only
if probe is failed for some drivers:

Thanks.
