Hi Stephen,

Thanks for review and sorry for late response due to national holiday
yesterday.

Yes, we need a pattern to verify this. The idea is try to make data
traffic busy and the CPU can still fall into LP2. So I used a software
video decoding process to verify this. You can image how the data
traffic it is. The raw video data from file system to memory. Memory to
memory access during video decoding process. The L1/L2 cache and TLB
maintenance procedure can be verified.

To verify this, you need to get a mplayer and "lower resolution" video
clips. Using DVD resolution would be good choice. Then creating two
decoding processes in the background. Please do check the system can
fall into LP2. If not, please try to lower the fps value. Finally, using
loop to keep the decoding process always in the background.

The criteria to pass the verification. The system need to keep alive
over a weekend at least.

Thanks,
Joseph
