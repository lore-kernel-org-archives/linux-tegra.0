It seems that there are some bugs in the PCI layer, no doubt
introduced after all your hard work.  We'll do our best to fix them.

The particular issue of pci_fixup_irqs() has been on my list for a
while, and we talked about it at the recent PCI mini-summit.  It's
clearly broken that we do this with for_each_pci_dev() once at
boot-time because that does nothing for hot-added devices.  It's also
broken that it is called after device_add() because the core shouldn't
touch the device after it's available to drivers.

This should get fixed reasonably soon, probably not in v3.6, but
hopefully in v3.7.  It's not completely trivial because many arches
have the same problem, and we need to fix all of them.
