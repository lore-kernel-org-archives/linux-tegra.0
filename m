I have applied this series, as follows:

* All code changes to Tegra's for-3.12/soc branch.
* All *.dts* changes to Tegra's for-3.12/dt branch.
* All defconfig changes to Tegra's for-3.12/defconfig branch.

I split patch 1/14 into separate code and DT changes in order to achieve
the split above. I hope you don't mind. It shouldn't affect
bisectability, since (a) PCIe support wasn't really useful before this
series anyway, and (b) the board *.dts changes were separate patches
anyway, so it wasn't quite fully bisectable in the first place.

Thanks.
