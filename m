So the question is what the DMA capabilities of the sdhci device are.

Usually I think SDHCI should just support a 64-bit mask, and you can
request that in the driver, but the platform might reject it, e.g.
if the parent bus is lacking a dma-ranges property.

On 32-bit platforms with no RAM above the 4GB boundary, setting a 64-bit
mask typically succeeds, because there is no harm in using it.

You should only set a 34-bit mask in the specific case that:

* SDHCI reports that it supports 64-bit addressing
* The parent bus supports 64-bit addressing and correctly sets up
  its dma-ranges property
* The device is connected incorrectly to the parent bus and
  any access above 0x400000000ull fail to end up in the correct
  memory for this particular device, but not other devices on the
  same bus.
