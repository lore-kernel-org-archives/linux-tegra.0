I guess the intention here was to avoid the conditional. This may also
have been cargo-culted from a time when we didn't have IS_ENABLED, and
the ifdefery required would've made this a lot worse.

The idea was, as I was saying below, to reuse dev_pm_ops even if
!CONFIG_PM. So pm_runtime_enable() could be something like this:

	pm_runtime_enable(dev)
	{
		if (!CONFIG_PM)
			if (dev->pm_ops->resume)
				dev->pm_ops->resume(dev);

		...
	}

But that's admittedly somewhat of a stretch. This could of course be
made somewhat nicer by adding an explicit variant, say:

	pm_runtime_enable_foo(dev)
	{
		if (!CONFIG_PM && dev->pm_ops->resume)
			return dev->pm_ops->resume(dev);

		return 0;
	}

Maybe the fact that I couldn't come up with a good name is a good
indication that this is a bad idea...

We do this on 64-bit ARM, but there had been some pushback when we had
proposed to do the same thing on 32-bit ARM. I think there were two
concerns:

	1) select PM would force the setting for all platforms on multi-
	   platforms builds

	2) prevents anyone from disabling PM for debugging purposes

1) no longer seems to be valid because Rockchip already selects PM
unconditionally. I'm not sure if 2) is valid anymore either. I haven't
run a build with !PM in a very long time and I wouldn't be surprised if
that was completely broken.

Maybe we need to try this again since a couple of years have elapsed and
runtime PM support on Tegra is much more mature at this point.

> Alternatively, you can make the driver depend on PM.

That's probably the easiest way out, but to be honest I think I'd prefer
to just enforce PM and keep things simple.

Jon, any objections?
