I think I knew what's your mean.
When I use "git send-email --to=3Dxxx *.patch" to send patches, I hit "=
 4.4.2
Message submission rate for this client has exceeded the configured lim=
it".
So I split them to send.
And I didn't realized it will cause problems before I sending out V9 se=
ries, so
I sent V9 patches one by one, they appear as individual emails on the m=
ailing
list, not as a thread.
I will check my email system and resend them.

Thanks.
Wei.
