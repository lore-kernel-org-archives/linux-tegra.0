This function is SoC specific code not a generic common code even I
modify it to more generic for checking the pending irq (SGI, PPI and
SPI). Different SoC had different design about it. For ex, some SoC only
put CPU core to power saving mode not include GIC, or there is another
irq controller can handle the case when CPU go into power saving mode.
Differenc SoC had different usage here (some need to check all pending
irq, some need to check SGI only and some even no need to consider
this).

I can move this into the function as a temp variable.
