So my next question is whether you intend to pass an iomem pointer
through this, or a some kind of structure, or both.  It matters,
because iomem pointers have a __iomem attribute to keep sparse
happy.  Having to force that attribute on and off pointers is frowned
upon, as it defeats the purpose of the sparse static checker.
