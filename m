One overall question here: For LP0, the idea is that the bootloader
provides the AVP boot code, puts it in RAM, passes the address to the
kernel, which then arranges for that code to be executed when the system
resumes from LP0. Why does the bootloader have to provide the code? Why
can't the AVP code simply be part of the kernel, just like e.g. the main
CPU's hotplug/secondary-power-on/power-saving reset vector is part of
the kernel? If we did that, it'd remove any need for bootloader support
for LP0 - the kernel would manage it entirely internally. That seems
much simpler.

I would create a new section here, with title something like:

Required properties when nvidia,suspend-mode is specified:

Then, for many of these properties, you can remove the text "If not
present, the suspend function will be disabled as default.", since it's
implicit given that these properties are required.

...

Again, you can remove "If the suspend mode is LP0, then this property is
must to have.", since the property is already in a section named
"Required properties ...".
