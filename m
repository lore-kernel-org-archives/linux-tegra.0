I wonder if it wouldn't be simpler to squash this patch into one of the
earlier patches, and just use coupled cpuidle from the very start?

So I assume that coupled cpuidle only calls this function on CPU 0 once
it has guaranteed that CPU n are all in this same idle state. What does
CPU 0 do now, when it wants to enter LP2 but can't because CPU n aren't
in LP2? Do we need to explicitly provide some kind of function to
implement this waiting state, or does coupled cpuidle ensure the LP3 is
entered, or implement WFI itself, or ...?

What if that changes; I assume couple cpuidle handles that by
registering a notifier?

Is there any way that the kernel can boot with only CPU 0 "plugged in",
but later have the other CPU hotplugged in? In other words, should that
hard-code a mask (3?) that describes the HW, rather than relying on the
runtime hotplug status? (think about what happens when this idle code is
moved into drivers/cpuidle/ and built as a module, and hence could be
initialized with only 1 CPU hotplugged in).
