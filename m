Yes, you're right, those were only to track the quilt mappings that we
used to do. I've removed them in the patch I just sent (v4).

DT updates usually go through the ARM SoC tree. It's usually okay to do
that because the DT stability requirement nicely decouples DT and driver
updates already.

In this particular case, the driver will be presented with a 256 MiB
window from existing DTs and simply use the first 4 KiB of that window
for the configuration space mapping. We can apply the DT patches at any
later time to reduce the region from 256 MiB to 4 KiB. I plan to do that
during for v4.17.
