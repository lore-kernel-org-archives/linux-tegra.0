That's a good time to start cleaning this up, especially since we
mandate single image from the beginning.

I think the whole ARCH_TEGRA_*_SOC approach is wrong. You don't bother
introducing Kconfig entries for individual drivers but instead add an
obj-*_SOC in various Makefiles under drivers/. If we ever get to a point
where we can build (part of) the SoCs as modules (and I'm not talking
about kernels shipped with end products but those distro kernel
targeting development boards), we have to go back and add such Kconfig
entries for specific drivers.

So if you do it properly from the beginning with per-driver Kconfig
entry, I no longer see the point of an ARCH_TEGRA_*_SOC option. It may
be more convenient for people building end products but they should know
better what components are required, defconfig is rarely meant for them.

I'm looking forward to a patch removing ARCH_TEGRA_132_SOC as well (you
can keep the 32-bit arm options if you'd like).
