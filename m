Virtual/emulated I interpret as purely implemented in software. That is
within the Linux kernel. Once you leave the domain of the kernel it's
no longer under the complete control of the kernel. So where exactly it
goes doesn't matter, it's pretty much the same as a hardware device from
the kernel's perspective.

But I guess you could define this differently.

Hardware UARTs don't usually have much more FIFO space than that either.

I don't think that would've been much smarter, especially not in this
case. As we discussed earlier, no matter how large you make the ring-
buffer you can always run into situations where you overflow it. The
ring-buffer implementation is also a lot more complicated and error-
prone. Plus there is the fact that in this particular case we actually
don't want buffering because the buffer may hide important information
in case of a crash.
