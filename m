I'd strongly prefer to NOT tie this into DT and keep it as in-kernel
implementation until we know more what a common subsystem might look
like, if any.

If we keep it only in the kernel, then we're free to change it as
needed. If we tie it into DT/syscon, then we get stick with
stable-only ABIs from day one. That doesn't seem like a good idea.
