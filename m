I've looked into this a bit, and it seems like ARM is using an open-
coded version of the pci_enable_resources() function here, with the only
difference being the unconditional enabling of both I/O and memory-
mapped access for bridges. On Tegra there is already a PCI fixup to do
this, so pci_enable_resources() can be used as-is. I came up with the
attached patch but haven't been able to test it yet.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: PCI: refactor pcibios_enable_device()

The implementation is an open-coded version on pci_enable_resources()
with a special case to enable I/O and memory-mapped functionality on
bridges. This commit reuses the existing PCI core implementation of the
pci_enable_resources() function. This also means that bridges no longer
enable I/O and memory-mapped functionality unconditionally. Platforms
where this is really required can add a corresponding fixup.
