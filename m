I haven't tried implementing that yet, but I'm sure it would work.  I
was just hoping to avoid having to do that ;-)

I suppose perhaps there is room for a shared helper here, to at least
avoid duplicating that in each IOMMU driver which needs the
stream-id's up front.

My understanding is that it is different from msm v1 IOMMU, although I
think it shares the same pagetable format with v1.  Not sure if that
is the same as arm-smmu?   If so it might be nice to try to extract
out some shared helper fxns for map/unmap as well.

I expect Olav knows better the similarities/differences.
