I haven't followed this thread so hopefully what I say is relevant. My 
take is:

If the DT binding is correct or reasonable, keep it.

If the Tegra DTs contain incorrect content, and never worked correctly 
in this aspect, then fix them. We do need to maintain DT 
ABI/compatibility, but I believe only with stuff that actually worked 
correctly. If the DT has a bug, just fix it.

That said, if ti,ac-detect-gpios is describing a host GPIO, then it's 
entirely arbitrary which polarity it should have, i.e. the polarity is 
not something specified by the bq24735 HW. In that case, feel free to 
change either the binding to match the DT or the DT to match the 
binding. Changing the DT to match the binding might still be better 
since there could be other users you're not aware of, and they might 
have written their DT correctly, and you don't want to break them.
