I have already confirmed with the ASIC team that the current iProc PCIe 
controller requires 32-bit aligned access into the configuration space 
due to the way how it was integrated into various iProc SoCs including 
NSP, Cygnus, and NS2.

This change will prevent the driver from working properly.

I've informed our ASIC team about this issue and all future iProc based 
SoCs should be able to support 8-bit, 16-bit access and therefore 
pci_generic_config_write/read can be used for those SoCs.

Thanks,

Ray
