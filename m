Ok I think I understand the problem now. The dummy timer is
registered with the cpu hotplug notifier first. Then the TWD is
registered, so what we get is a clockevent_register(dummy)
followed by a clockevent_register(twd) on every hotplug (probably
something we should optimize later). Regardless, when we hotplug
out the CPU, the broadcast device is in oneshot mode. When we
hotplug back in the CPU, the dummy event gets added first and
fills in the per-cpu tickdevice slot for CPU1.

When this happens we have to start the broadcast timer and the
code there just forces the broadcast device to use the periodic
broadcast handler (see tick_device_uses_broadcast()) without
checking to see if the mode is periodic. Once that event handler
is assigned to periodic broadcast we're in danger of getting an
interrupt and trying to emulate oneshot mode when we shouldn't
be.

Can you try this patch?
