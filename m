Sorry, Just to be clear on my understanding of your suggestion,

3 ways of CS control implementation is needed for Tegra SPI
- SW CS thru SPI Controller
- HW CS thru SPI Controller
- Direct GPIO based CS control=20

Patch Series includes both HW CS and also direct GPIO based CS.

Regarding direct GPIO based CS, I understood you prefer to use GPIO descrip=
tors.
I see SPI core set_cs API also uses GPIO descriptor for direct GPIO control=
 of CS.=20

Tegra SPI driver need parallel implementation of direct gpio based cs to hw=
/sw based
CS control thru SPI controller.
Since SPI core set_cs already has implementation using gpio descriptors, in=
 V3 I am using
the same API.

Any concerns for using set_cs API from SPI core as it already does direct g=
pio based cs using
Descriptors?

Thanks
