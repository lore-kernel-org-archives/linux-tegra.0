From my experience (maybe not as long as yours :)) but these kind of
things would be handled by the controller. At least with previous SOCs
that I have used, PXA270, PXA300 and i.MX SOCs.

That it has an address range per chip-select PIN and timing registers
per chip-select. And thus eliminating a need for a infrastructure or
framework.
