Hi Stephen,

thanks very much for the review -

Indeed - this is now fixed in the copy of the README.txt that's on the 
server.  The correct URL should be:

http://www.pwsan.com/tegra/testlogs/test_v3.10-rc1/20130519152115/

Looks like the -rc2 through -rc4 URLs are correct.

For the moment, yes.  I haven't gotten comfortable with distributing 
executable code yet.

In the boot test environment here, "t33beaver" uniquely identifies the 
board, while "tegra30-beaver" identifies the DTB used to boot it.  
So if an alternate DTB were used, the boot test path would be:

../boot/t33beaver/tegra30-beaver-alternate/

If it's important to you, I'll change it.  Otherwise, I'd prefer not to 
call the board 'tegra30-beaver' -- mostly to avoid confusing myself 
between the board name and the DTB name :-)

Certainly - will figure out which of these are actually needed for the 
mainline kernel, and will update the kernel command line.
