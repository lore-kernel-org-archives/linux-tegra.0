Thanks.

The script was a little too over-zealous.  It was just supposed to do
the following transformation:

--- => =-DO NOT APPLY-=
+++ => =+DO NOT APPLY+=

which would've made it reversible with a trivial sed expression - but I
cocked up because of the utterly random nature of regexp flavours, and
instead gave sed this:

	sed -i 's/^---/=-DO NOT APPLY-=/;s/^\+\+\+/=+DO NOT APPLY+=/'

The escaped '+' ends up causing sed to match a single + at the beginning
of a line.  (Other regexp flavours require you to escape the '+' otherwise
it's interpreted as "one or more".)

I had added that mode to my script a few months ago, and I just assumed
I'd fully tested it when I used it yesterday... clearly not so.

So... yes it was designed to stop it being _accepted_ but it should have
also been completely reversible for those who wished to apply it via
the obvious reversed sed expression.

in database were 13.1 to 19Mbit for a good line, about 7.5+ for a bad.
Estimate before purchase was "up to 13.2Mbit".
