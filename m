I suspect when the CLOCK_EVENT_NOTIFY_EXIT is after the
local_irq_enable, we have the timer handler executed before where it
sets the tick_broadcast_pending_mask.

Hence in the tick_broadcast_oneshot_control function when we fall into
the condition:

 if (dev->next_event.tv64 =3D=3D KTIME_MAX)
	goto out;

The tick_broadcast_pending_mask is not cleared and when re-entering wit=
h
CLOCK_EVENT_NOTIFY_ENTER, this mask is set and that raises the warning.

So, if I am not wrong, the condition to raise this warning would be:

 1. use the flag (of course), because the
CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_EXIT is called after the local_irq_enabled

 2. there is no timer planned after the expired one.

 3. a new timer is created and the cpu enters the low power state again

The first step would be to create a simple program to reproduce easily
the warning.

=46irst boot the kernel with init=3D/bin/bash (or whatever, the init pr=
ocess
is replaced by a shell), thus reducing considerably the number of timer=
s.

Then try to raise the warning with cpu2:

	taskset 4 /bin/sleep 0.5

=2E.. several times until the warning appears.

As I don't have the hardware, this is based on assumptions, so may be I
am wrong.
