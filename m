We had something a bit similar in Nokia. First versions had an
"independent" backlight controlled via pwm. Later versions had a
backlight that is controlled by the panel IP, so it was changed by
sending DSI commands to the panel.

Yes, I think the backlight and the panel should be considered separate
devices. Just like, say, a touch screen and a panel may happen to be in
the same display module, a backlight and a panel can be in the same
display module. They are still separate, independent things, although
they are, of course, used together.
