e little it does (which is mainly swapping in the GPIO chip select instead =
of the hardware chip select) isn't used in your driver usage of this as far=
 as I can see.  The bulk of the chip select handling code in the core is ac=

it's own implementation of that; I've not looked in enough detail to figure=

In SPI Tegra driver, we wanted to have GPIO based CS control when cs-gpios =
is specified in parallel to HW/SW CS. Having parallel GPIO based CS is to m=
imic some of the timing stuff that's needed for some spi devices by not act=
ually using HW CS on platform but only for SPI HW design logic inside the c=
hip.

Tegra spi driver don't use set_cs callback so looking into spi_set_cs from =
spi core implementation when cs-gpios property is used it exactly the same =
that is needed for GPIO control CS. So used this in V3.=20

Can you please provide more details on what you are suggesting?
Do you prefer not to use SPI core spi_set_cs and gpio_set_values APIs and i=
nstead implement in tegra SPI driver using GPIO descriptors ?

Thanks
