Layers within kernel space have to trust each other. A badly written
client can break the consumer in so many ways, we can not catch every
possibility.

Being able to put the message on bus in atomic context is a feature -
which we do support. But busy-waiting in a loop is not a feature, and
we don't want to encourage that.
