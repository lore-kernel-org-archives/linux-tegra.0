Those patches above are dealing with CPUs coming back up.  If you look 
at the rest of the series, especially the DCSCB one providing real usage 
example, you'll see that we do have a mix of coherent and non-coherent 
states that need to coordinate amongst themselves.

It was initiated for b.L hence the name, but that is applicable to other 
systems as well.
