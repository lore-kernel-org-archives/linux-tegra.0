I had a quick chat with Robin (CC'ed, who has dealt/is dealing with most
of the work this thread relates to) and I think that as things stand,
for MSI physical addresses, an offset between PCI->host address shift is
not really contemplated (ie 1:1 host<->pci is assumed).

IIUC, all these host bridges need is a physical address that is routed
upstream to the host bridge by the PCIe tree (ie it is not part of the
host bridge windows), as long as the host bridge intercepts it (and
endpoints do _not_ reuse it for something else) that should be fine, as
it has been pointed out in this thread, allocating a page is a solution
- there may be others (which are likely to be platform specific).

I will look into this with Robin's help.
