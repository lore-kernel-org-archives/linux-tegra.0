Quite frankly, I'm fairly sure most of this is untested anyway. There
isn't a good way to test gr3d for example.

Generally I lean towards not merging any code that we don't know is
needed. Merely because Android kernels do something doesn't mean it is
necessary to do it (or even sane in some cases).

Now I understand that it might be difficult to test this, but that's all
the more reason not to include the code. If we find that we have bugs
that this can fix, then we can come up with tests to trigger it and
validate that the fix actually fixes something.

In other words, I don't think it makes sense to implement mechanisms to
recover from situations that we have no way of triggering in the first
place.
