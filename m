Hi Tomi,

That's mostly a framework issue. Most frameworks do not export a function that 
allow to dereference a phandle - they expect resources to be declared right 
under the device node and accessed by name through foo_get(device, name). So 
using phandles in power sequences would require to export these additional 
functions and also opens the door to some inconsistencies - for instance, your 
PWM phandle could be referenced a second time in the sequence with a different 
period - how do you know that these are actually referring the same PWM 
device?

We discussed that issue already (around v5 I think) and the conclusion was 
that it should be up to the driver. When we simply enable/disable resources it 
is easy to revert, but in the future non-boolean properties will likely be 
introduced, and these cannot easily be reverted. Moreover some drivers might 
have more complex recovery needs. This deserves more discussion I think, as 
I'd like to have some "generic" recovery mechanism that covers most of the 
cases.

Alex.
