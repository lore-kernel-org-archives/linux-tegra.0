Yes.

Almost. That's still missing the key information that the data format is
one bit per fuse, and the ordering. Perhaps change from:

The data is layed out in 32bit words in LSB first format.

to:

The data is laid out in 32bit words in LSB first format. Each bit
represents a single fuse value. Bits order/assignment exactly matches
the HW registers, including any unused bits.
