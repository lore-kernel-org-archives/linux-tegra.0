An additional problem with this is that we'd have to add the following
to the pcie-controller node:

	#address-cells =3D <1>;
	#size-cells =3D <0>;

This will conflict with the "ranges" property, because suddenly we can
no longer map the regions properly. Maybe Mitch can comment on whether
this is possible or not?

To make it clearer what I'm talking about, here's the DT snippet again
(with the compatible property removed from the pci@ nodes because they
are no longer probed by a driver, the "simple-bus" removed from the
pcie-controller node's compatible property removed and its #address-
and #size-cells properties adjusted as described above).

	pcie-controller {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-pcie";
		reg =3D <0x80003000 0x00000800   /* PADS registers */
		       0x80003800 0x00000200   /* AFI registers */
		       0x80004000 0x00100000   /* configuration space */
		       0x80104000 0x00100000>; /* extended configuration space */
		interrupts =3D <0 98 0x04   /* controller interrupt */
			      0 99 0x04>; /* MSI interrupt */
		status =3D "disabled";

		ranges =3D <0x80000000 0x80000000 0x00002000   /* 2 root ports */
			  0x80400000 0x80400000 0x00010000   /* downstream I/O */
			  0x90000000 0x90000000 0x10000000   /* non-prefetchable memory */
			  0xa0000000 0xa0000000 0x10000000>; /* prefetchable memory */

		#address-cells =3D <1>;
		#size-cells =3D <0>;

		pci@0 {
			reg =3D <2>;
			status =3D "disabled";

			#address-cells =3D <3>;
			#size-cells =3D <2>;

			ranges =3D <0x81000000 0 0 0x80400000 0 0x00008000   /* I/O */
				  0x82000000 0 0 0x90000000 0 0x08000000   /* non-prefetchable memory */
				  0xc2000000 0 0 0xa0000000 0 0x08000000>; /* prefetchable memory */

			nvidia,ctrl-offset =3D <0x110>;
			nvidia,num-lanes =3D <2>;
		};

		pci@1 {
			reg =3D <1>;
			status =3D "disabled";

			#address-cells =3D <3>;
			#size-cells =3D <2>;

			ranges =3D <0x81000000 0 0 0x80408000 0 0x00008000   /* I/O */
				  0x82000000 0 0 0x98000000 0 0x08000000   /* non-prefetchable memory */
				  0xc2000000 0 0 0xa8000000 0 0x08000000>; /* prefetchable memory */

			nvidia,ctrl-offset =3D <0x118>;
			nvidia,num-lanes =3D <2>;
		};
	};

AIUI none of the ranges properties are valid anymore, because the bus
represented by pcie-controller no longer reflects the truth, namely that
it translates the CPU address space to the PCI address space.

I suppose this could work if we passed the 'struct device' of the pcie-
controller node as the parent for all ports instead of requiring a
separate device for each port. That way the pcie-controller would get to
be a parent for two/three bridges on Tegra20/30.

I'll have a go at the implementation, but I'm busy with other stuff and
it will probably be some time before I can get back on it.
