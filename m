Nit-pick ... the Tegra documentation refers to this controller as the
GMI (general memory interface) or SNOR (sync-NOR) controller because it
is not just limited to NOR as you mentioned. I see references to GMI in
the Tegra pinctrl driver and so may be we should use this name.

I see at least one difference at the register level between Tegra20 and
Tegra30 and so I think this should be something like ...

 - compatible : Should contain one of the following:
	For Tegra20 must contain "nvidia,tegra20-gmi".
 	For Tegra30 must contain "nvidia,tegra30-gmi".

There is also a SNOR_MIO_CONFIG for the MIO address space and so I think
that this should be nvidia,snor-config to be explicit. It might be nice
to also add a "nvidia,mio-config" while you are at it as well, however,
that could always be done later. If you do, then the
"nvidia,snor-config" becomes optional depending on whether you are using
the SNOR or MIO address space.

Thierry, Stephen, do prefer all the fields on the config registers are
broken out? There are quite a few but I am not sure what we typically
recommend here?

Although it is true, you do have the MIO address space and so you could
support two devices via the SNOR address space and MIO address space
(assuming that the MIO can be used for the 2nd device).

Furthermore, if you do have external logic to support multiple devices
this would assume that the devices use the same timing and so are
probably the same type. It also assumes both can fit in the 256MB
address range. May be worth mentioning.

The GMI does have 8 chip selects and I believe the purpose of these is
to allow you to address more than the 256MB range. However, I believe to
do this it require software intervention to change the current CS that
is in use.

I wonder if it is worth mentioning that the chip-select specified in the
"nvidia,config" prop should match that in the "ranges" prop unless you
have some external decoding logic to provide an external chip-select.
Which raises a question, what does the chip-select in the ranges
actually represent? I am not sure if there is a common practice here for
device tree when boards have external logic to provide additional
chip-selects. I am sure this is quite common.

The "nvidia,config" appears to be missing here.
