I see what you mean now, and I agree we don't want to do this like
pci_common_init(), but the patch here does a number of things very
differently:

- it's not architecture specific
- it is not tied into architecture specific pcibios_* functions
- it does not create multiple bridges at once
- it does not have three levels of callbacks going back and forth,
  the idea is to eventually end up with one structure for the
  callback pointers including those that today are done as __weak
  functions.

Today we only have four callers of pci_common_init_dev that probe the
PCI host from DT: cns3xxx, versatile, mvebu and rcar-gen2. I hope
we can replace all of them with the new method here directly and
not take any intermediate steps.

The users of pci_common_init() (not _dev) are limited to board files
on really old platforms that are either not getting updated (ixp, iop,
footbridge, ks8695, mv78xx0, sa1100) or that have DT based replacement
code coming (dove, orion5x, cns3xxx, integrator).

Sorry, I'm not really following what you mean with that, or what the
consequence is for the Linux implementation. Can you try to rephrase this?
