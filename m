Yes, the DFLL clock driver could restore the voltage, however, that
does not guarantee that the voltage is still sufficient for the other
clock source.

Yes, that's my point. When switching between these clock sources, I
think that software does need to set something and so we should care.

The hardware will not randomly change the voltage until the DFLL is
enabled and so you would have to do this before.

Yes, setting the frequency and voltage as defined by a given operating
mode would make sense. However, I am not sure we have those defined in
the kernel for this PLL and would have to be added.

I was thinking that during boot we could read the default voltage and
frequency set by the bootloader and use this as it should not be
changing dynamically at this point because the cpufreq driver has not
been activated yet.
