It does make me a little sad that the DT bindings need to specify the
number of steps but otherwise this looks good (modulo the minor comments
Stephen had as well):

I think regardless of the current discussion about some of the
applications (like pwm-backlight) there are going to be cases where this
is useful even if it ends up being more as library code for drivers than 
as something that users work with directly.
