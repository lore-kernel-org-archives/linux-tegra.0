That is the opposite of what I intended :(

I really meant that you don't need my Ack: the Tegra changes got an
Ack from the subarch maintainers and the drivers/pinctrl changes are
for you to judge. I don't have the resources to look into every patch
with the level of detail required to make a final decision, I really
have to rely on someone I trust like you to decide if something goes
in or not. Of course I can offer an opinion when you ask me, which
I did, but also didn't feel I understand the patch well enough to
ack them -- even though it looks reasonable to me.

Regarding the process, you have my full Ack on the plan to merge
them into mainline through your tree when you find them good enough
and also put a copy into the arm-soc tree if needed to resolve
any dependencies or conflicts with other stuff in arm-soc.

Ok, I see.

Yes, that's exactly what I understood.

Ok, thanks for the explanation.

Sounds good enough for me. Anyone who wants a single kernel that runs on
a lot different machines (distros like ubuntu, fedora, debian, opensuse)
typically relies on initramfs already, the others can have the code built-in.
