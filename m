Let me make clear, I am not against your proposal for change, as long as
you provide enough info so that we can design the API properly. For new
APIs, it is hard to design it, see its benefits and understand why
existing APIs are not enough if we do not see at least one user of the
new API. In other words, yes, I am open to changes, as long as I can
properly understand it.
