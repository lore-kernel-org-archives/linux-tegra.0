A lot of these mux/divider/gate clocks go out to peripherals, whose
drivers want to call both clk_set_rate() and clk_en/disable() on the clock.

There's only 1 clock reaching the peripheral in HW, so the driver should
only call clk_get() once, and similarly the DT should only provide a
single clock to the driver.

Given the mux->divider->gate clock construction, that clock would
presumably be the gate object. clk_en/disable() clearly work there, but
is clk_set_rate() intended to propagate up the chain until it can be
satisfied, i.e. does the gate clock object's set_rate() op simply call
the parent's set_rate() op?

If the order were instead mux->gate->divider, would it be correct for
enable/disable to propagate from the divider to the gate?

I'm hoping we can represent this in device tree somehow, so that
individual boards can set the clock tree up differently depending on
their needs (e.g. Tegra20 doesn't have quite enough PLLs, so sometimes a
particular PLL will be used to generate the 2nd display's pixel clock,
whereas on other boards it may be used for some peripherals). So, we'd
like to describe this in DT.

It seems like it'd be pretty common to want the kernel to fully
initialize the clock tree, and to do this from device tree, so perhaps
this might evolve into a common (part of) a cross-SoC clock binding, or
some kind of utility function that parsed a clock-tree-init-table from DT?
