It is true that most (perhaps all) power sequences can be associated
with a specific device, but if we go and implement drivers for these
kinds of devices we will probably end up with loads of variations of
the same scheme.

Lets take display panels as an example. One of the devices that we build
has gone through two generations so far and both are slightly different
in how they control the panel backlight: one has an external backlight
controller, the other has the display controller built into the panel.
However, from the board's perspective the control of the backlight
doesn't change, because both devices get the same inputs (an enable pin
and a PWM) that map to the same pins on the SoC.

This may not be a very good example because the timing isn't relevant,
but the basic point is still valid: if we provide a driver for both
panel devices, the code will be exactly the same. So we end up having to
refactor to avoid code duplication and use the same driver for a number
of backlight/panel combinations. Which in itself isn't very bad, but it
also means that we'll probably get to see a large number of "generic"
drivers which aren't very generic after all.

Another problem, which also applies to the case of power-sequences, is
that often the panel and backlight are not the same device. So you could
have the same panel with any number of different backlight controllers
or vice-versa any number of different panels with the same backlight
controller.
