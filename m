Hi MyungJoo,

Thank for your answer, see my answers inline.

Sorry for poor choice of naming. "Load threshold interrupt" might be 
more appropriate. The idea of the series here is to add an ability to 
program hardware to give interrupts when the current load value goes 
above (or below) certain threshold(s). I will revisit the naming.

The device profile is responsible to call this function from an 
interrupt handler. I will document this.

Yes, the idea is to use the enumerations for informing the type of the 
event. I.e. from interrupt handler we might call:
   devfreq_watermark_event(devfreq, ACTMON_INTR_BELOW_WMARK);

I am not convinced that creating two separate interfaces is better than 
extending a single centralised interface. Let us first consider the 
compatibility...:

First, in trivial case the device driver does not implement the 
threshold feature. Obviously we cannot use threshold based governor for 
scaling but all existing polling based governors will work as earlier.

Second, let us assume that we have a device that supports threshold 
interrupts and the driver has implemented the required set_h/l_wmark 
interrupts and calls devfreq_watermark_event() when we get an interrupt. 
This device can therefore use wmark_simple and wmark_active governors. 
In addition to the wmark governors, we may choose to use a polling based 
governor. With current approach the polling governor simply ignores the 
events and leaves the thresholds "as is".

In short, I would not be concerned on compatibility. From governor side 
it should be ok to ignore an event. In addition, it is ok from governor 
initialization to fail in case the device driver does not implement all 
required features.


I am also afraid that initialisation makes two-communication-paths 
approach tricky. In code you likely could have..:
   devfreq_add_device(dev, &pdata->devfreq, "wmark_simple", &extra_fns);

.. but what happens if we wish to change the governor on the fly through 
sysfs? In worst case this is targeting to a governor that requires its 
own data field in initialisation.

set_h/l_wmark callbacks should be implemented by the device profiles 
(the device drivers themselves) for setting the thresholds on hardware. 
These are not devfreq/governor private functions but something that 
should be implemented inside the device driver.

This should work.

I would like to see is that we could easily take advantage of hardware 
features and not let framework limit us too much. :-)

For example, Tomeu has been working on ACTMON driver that measures 
memory transfers (please refer to "Add support for Tegra Activity 
Monitor" series). This hardware block is capable of generating 
interrupts based on activity and hence by factoring the series properly, 
we could use the same governor from the series in different places 
easily. Without proper interfacing everyone ends up duplicating the code.
