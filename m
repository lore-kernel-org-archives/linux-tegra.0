Ok, yeah that should be fine. Alternatively, applying only these
patches on a separate branch that you pull into your main for-3.4
branch means that if you have to rebase the rest of for-3.4 you can
get away with it as long as you yet again only pull in this branch
instead of include it in the rebase.
