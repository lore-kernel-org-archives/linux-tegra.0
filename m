Chris,

If you can take this for 3.9, everything is simple. I understand it's
very late for that.

If this goes into 3.10, then there will be some dependencies. Can you
ack this patch so that I can take it through the Tegra tree? The reason
being: I know that Joseph Lo will be posting some patches to this file
that need to go through the Tegra tree due to device tree dependencies,
and the simplest way to resolve it is just to take all changes to this
file through the Tegra tree in 3.10. Thanks.
