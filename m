I think the above binding would be the correct way to describe things
if you have 1 device connected to 2 IOMMUs (directly rather than
chained). IIUC, that is something you have on tegra?

For the topology above where you are chaining iommu's, I think
something like this is more accurately describing the hierarchy:

  smmu_b: iommu@xxxxxxxx {
        #iommu-cells = <3>;
         iommus = <&smmu_a param1 param2>;
       ....
  };
  device_a {
         iommus = <&smmu_b param1 param2 param3>;
  };

I remember discussing this with Will and seem to recall some issue
with describing things this way. But looking at it now, I don't see
what that was.

It is not trying to follow the bus hierarchy. Inheritance is just a
convenience. Interrupts don't follow the bus hierarchy either.
