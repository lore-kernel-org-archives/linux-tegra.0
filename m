Yes, I think that makes sense.

So I assume you need to make some/all of those modifications before we can
apply this patch?

Oh right... Maybe I'm misunderstanding continuous mode works then; I
thought that the client driver queued a request once, and it continued
to execute forever until either a new request was queued to replace it,
or the original request for dequeued. It looks like instead, the req
is always removed from the queue once we've seen both the ping and the
pong interrupts. Am I totally misunderstanding what's happening?
