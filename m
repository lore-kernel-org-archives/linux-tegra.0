The above comment appears to be incorrect. Looking further at the code,
the code seems fine but the comment is confusing. I think you mean to
say that 'the period needs to be greater than the minimum period' and
that ...

 min period = max clock limit >> PWM_DUTY_WIDTH
 max period = min clock limit >> PWM_DUTY_WIDTH >> PWM_SCALE_WIDTH
