Well, the console assumes there exists an atomic path to put character
on the bus, But because there isn't in case of tcu, we have to emulate
that. Frankly I prefer the one-off driver jump some hoops, rather than
implement exceptions in the api.
BTW, there is already no rate-limitation because its all virtual -
data is consumed as fast as possible.

The idea is console and uart-ops both feed into this buffer and the
only consumer thread runs the mailbox.

I am happy to see features and bugfixes added to the api. What I am
not eager about is supporting less than 100% legit and very platform
specific usecases, especially when there is a work around.

Thanks.
