The dependency chain goes like this: "Tegra SDHCI update the pad
autocal procedure" -> "Tegra SDHCI enable 1.8 V signaling on Tegar210
and Tegra186" -> "Tegra PMC pinctrl pad configuration".

From a functionality perspective there's no strict dependency, however,
I don't think "[PATCH v2 09/10] mmc: tegra: Perform pad calibration
after voltage switch" can be applied cleanly without
"[PATCH v2 03/10] mmc: tegra: Reconfigure pad voltages during voltage
switching" from the "Tegra SDHCI enable 1.8 V signaling on Tegar210 and
Tegra186" series.

I've sent the changes in multiple part because I've been working on
further changes to the driver while the previous parts have been
getting reviewed. This is still the case and there's still going to be
at least one more series which adds support for HS200 tuning and some
smaller changes after it. However, the HS200 work is probably going to
be ready for review in a day or two. I can send these as a one series
from now on, although at this point it would be 27 patches in total
and even more with the HS200 patches.

I can do that if you prefer to do it that way. Makes my life somewhat
easier too.
