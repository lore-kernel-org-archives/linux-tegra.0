Coming back to this, I did actually change
gen_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges() to call my new function in
[16/25] "PCI: generic: Request host bridge window resources with core
function".

The gen_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges() is still there and it still
contains the loop to deal with the I/O port space and to validate that
a non-prefetchable memory window exists.  Both of those could probably
be made more generic later.
