Sorry, I forgot this one. I will use a "#define" to replace it.

This code is safe here. Because we have some protection code.

We have the function (tegra_lp1_iram_hook and tegra_sleep_core_init) to
check if the system didn't support LP1 yet, then it will fall back to
LP2. I verified this too.

So should I still move them to the last patch?
