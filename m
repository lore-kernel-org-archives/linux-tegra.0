Yes. But only for device tree.

Unbind/remove() calls are the inverse usually yes.

But also the [runtime] power up/down sequences for the
devices tend to depend on a similar ordering or mostly
the same. (Mentioned this before I think.)

Yes you are right. But what about ACPI, board files,
Simple Firmware and future hardware description languages...
