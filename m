Isn't this more of a 'get'?

Isn't this just the device associated with the PM domain we are getting?

Should this be 'NULL in the case where the @dev already has a power-domain'?

I wonder if this is worthy of a ...

	if (WARN_ON(dev->pm_domain))

Don't we consider this an error case? I wonder why not return PTR_ERR 
here as well? This would be consistent with dev_pm_domain_attach().
