Despite this board having been derived from Nyan, it isn't Nyan, so I=20
don't think Nyan should be part of any compatible value, nor a separate=
=20
compatible value.

Underscores are consistent with at least all the other Tegra DTs, so I=20
think this is best as is.

We certainly do have the pwm label in *.dtsi for other SoCs, so we=20
should probably move the label there.

Using the &pwm {} syntax would be inconsistent with all the other Tegra=
=20
DTs, and isn't really any safer; the HW isn't going to change, so once=20
this is written, it should continue to "just work".
