Yes, there's certainly a way to extend the binding in a
backwards-compatible way.

However, I have seen in Rob and/or Grant push back on not fully
defining bindings in the past - i.e. actively planning to initially
create a minimal binding and extend it in the future, rather than
completely defining it up-front.

I don't know how strong of a rule they intend that to be though. If we
get to the point of moving the DT bindings out of the kernel, it'd be
good to get a concrete definition of what can and can't be changed in
bindings.

How do you see that working: something automatic inside clk_set_rate()
seeing that some other parent could provide the rate, so the clock
could be reparented, or ...?
