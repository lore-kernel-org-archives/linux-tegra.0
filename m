Well, I'm not quite sure why exactly everyone is so focused on probing here.

Probing is just one aspect of the fact that we need functional dependencies
to be tracked somehow and acted on when necessary.  And this is not limited
to probing, as I have already said for a few times.  Other cases include:
system shutdown, system suspend/resume, runtime PM, unbinding of drivers.

If there is a functional dependency between two devices (say, B requires A
to be present and functional, meaning that the driver of A has to be present
and working for the driver of B to be working), all of the above need to be
done in a specific order.

Today, however, the driver core only knows about structural dependencies
and only in the specific parent-child case.

So perhaps it's better to start discussing about a solution for the general
issue?

Thanks,
Rafael
