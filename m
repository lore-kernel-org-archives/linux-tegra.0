This doesn't have anything to do with virtual clocks. As you mention,
it's just about constraints.

One user of clock "cpu" wants min rate 216MHz. Another wants max rate
1GHz. cpufreq will request some rate between the 2, or be capped to
those limits. These set of imposed constraints would need to be stored
per client of the clock, not per HW clock, since many clients could set
different max rates (e.g. thermal throttle 1.5GHz due to temperature,
CPU policy 1GHz due to the user selecting low CPU power, etc.)

Similarly for audio, of there are N clients of 1 clock/PLL, and they
each want the PLL to run at a different rate, something needs to detect
that and deny it.
