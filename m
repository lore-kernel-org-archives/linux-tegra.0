Tegra20 DVFS is a little bit complicated due to the fact that we can't 
scale VDD_CPU directly, there are constraints or relationship to other 
power rails so I don't think it is a good idea to use generic 
cpufreq-cpu0 driver if we're going to support voltage scaling.

Actually the latest version is v4 which is quite different against v3.
