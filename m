Exactly.

I guess that might work but what the original designer(s) probably meant by that strange otherwise nonexistent cdev2 clock might be the other configuration of that pad group called OSC which would allow outputting the base Oscillator frequency even with a separate divider allowing by 2, 4 or even 8 as far as I remember from glancing at the TRM. However like you correctly noted no design ever made use of any such as far as I can tell.

Sounds a little too fancy to me but might work if device tree backwards compatibility is required at utmost importance.
