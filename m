Yes, several drivers have their own functions to parse MMC DT bindings, 
whereas, I think, a common helper function can be used to parse generic 
MMC bindings.

The goal is to make all MMC host drivers, running on DT-enabled systems, 
use the new mmc_of_parse() function and, additionally, their own parser 
for any their host-specific properties. As I wrote in the patch commit 
message, if we get all drivers converted to use it, it can be later 
integrated into mmc_alloc_host().

The best would be to (1) convert SDHCI core to use mmc_of_parse(), (2) 
have all SDHCI implementations use that feature either implicitly, having 
SDHCI core call it automatically during its initialisation, or explicitly, 
during their own probing.

As I said, SDHCI (and other host drivers) should be converted to use 
mmc_of_parse() in addition to their own vendor-specific DT property 
parsing.
