Yes, that was our intention as well. Our initial plan was to use an
address from the PCI aperture within Tegra that wasn't being used for
any other purpose. However, we ran into some odd corner cases where this
wasn't working as expected. As a temporary solution we wanted to move to
GFP_DMA32 (or GFP_DMA) in order to support 32-bit only MSI endpoints.

Eventually we'll want to get rid of the allocation altogether, we just
need to find a set of values that work reliably. In the meantime, it
looks as though GFP_DMA would be the right solution as long as we have
to stick with __get_free_pages().

Alternatively, since we've already verified that the MSI writes are
never committed to memory, we could choose some random address pointing
to system memory as well, but I'm reluctant to do that because it could
end up being confusing for users (and developers) to see some random
address showing up somewhere. A physical address such as the beginning
of system memory should always work and might be unique enough to
indicate that it is special.
