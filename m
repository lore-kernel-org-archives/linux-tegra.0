Sure.

My expectation is that register_trusted_foundations() is called by the
platform code once it has established (through whatever mean it likes)
that Trusted Foundations is required. For platforms supporting DT,
of_register_trusted_foundations() takes care of that. Platforms that
don't support DT need another way to decide whether they *need* TF or
not. Once a platform decided that it needs TF, its absence is not an
option, and therefore I'd think that register_trusted_foundations()
should hard-fail if support is not compiled in. Or maybe I missed your
point?

Alex.
