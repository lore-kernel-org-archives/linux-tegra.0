It seems to be convention that extended config space is often only
accessible through mmio space, that was true on x86 last I checked
too..

You could decrease the size of the mapping to only span the bus
numbers that are configured for use via DT.

Are there any concerns about these config registers being accessed
from a context where a new mapping can't be made? Interrupt? Machine
Check? PCI-E Advanced Error Reporting?

Cheers,
Jason
