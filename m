Alright, putting the functions into pci_ops doesn't sound like a very
good idea then. Or perhaps it would make sense for hardware where the
root complex and the MSI controller are handled by the same driver.
Basically it could be done as a shortcut and if those are not filled
in, the drivers could still opt to look up an MSI controller from a
phandle specified in DT.

Even another alternative would be to keep the functions within the
struct pci_ops and use generic ones if an external MSI controller is
used. Just tossing around ideas.
