Right, so I've updated the patches, and added one ack to one patch.
That seems insufficient to me - the only platform these have been
tested on is iMX6, which is sdhci-esdhc-imx.c.

They _really_ need testing elsewhere too.  Or is the plan to merge
them and then see about getting people to test them and fix them up
afterwards?
