True, it appears that each register is logically part of MC or GART/SMMU
functionality. In that case, chunks of registers can be assigned to
specific drivers. However, the memory map is rather interleaved:

Tegra20:

00c-01c: MC
024-034: GART
03c-270: MC

Tegra30:

010-038: SMMU
050-220: MC
228-280: SMMU
29c-36c: MC

Perhaps the simplest way is to represent those chunks as separate reg
entries:

    mc@7000f010 {
        compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-mc";
        reg = <0x7000f010 0x1d4 0x70000228 0xd4>;
    };

    smmu@0x70000050 {
        compatible = "nvidia,tegra30-smmu";
        reg = <0x70000010 0x2c 0x70000228 0x5c>;
    };

This could all be hidden inside e.g. smmu_read():

static inline u32 smmu_read(struct smmu_device *smmu, size_t offs)
{
	BUG_ON(offs < 0x10);
	if (offs < 0x40)
        	return readl(smmu->regsa + offs - 0x10);
	BUG_ON(offs < 0x228);
	if (offs < 0x370)
        	return readl(smmu->regsb + offs - 0x228);
	BUG();
}

This would optimize out, since most likely "offs" would be a #define for
the register address.

Then there would be no need for the DT nodes or devices/drivers to
interact at all.

We should really talk to our HW engineers and make sure that future
chips don't get even more interleaved register maps - either make sure
the current layout is perpetuated exactly, or fix it to make them
entirely separate. Can you please start an internal thread with them on
this topic, Hiroshi?

I'd certainly rather avoid drivers reaching into other devices to get
register windows, unless this is more explicitly managed by passing the
data from one device to another via an API for this purpose. The code
above feels quite fragile/dangerous.
