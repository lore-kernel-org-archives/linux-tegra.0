For what it's worth, we are ready to land this in Chrome OS. I think
this series has been very well discussed and reviewed, hasn't changed
much in the last few spins, and is in good enough shape to use as a
base for future patches. Georgi's also done a great job reaching out
to other SoC vendors, and there appears to be enough consensus that
this framework will be usable by more than just Qualcomm. There are
also several drivers out on the list trying to add patches to use this
framework, with more to come, so it made sense (to us) to get this
base framework nailed down. In my experiments this is an important
piece of the overall power management story, especially on systems
that are mostly idle.

I'll continue to track changes to this series and we will ultimately
reconcile with whatever happens upstream, but I thought it was worth
sending this note to express our "thumbs up" towards this framework.
