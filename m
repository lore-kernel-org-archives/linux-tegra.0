Felipe, (and Alan, Greg),

These are the changes from the Tegra tree that need to be merged
before the Tegra USB driver patches 4-8 from Venu can be applied. Recall
that we had previously agreed on this approach for v3.9, but Venu's
patches didn't end up being ready until now, unfortunately. I note
that Venu's patches affect both the Tegra USB and PHY drivers.

Following this, I will soon send some patches that fix up some ARM multi-
platform issues in the Tegra EHCI driver. Those won't affect the Tegra
USB PHY driver, but I do expect I'll want to rebase them on top of Venu's
series, since they will probably interact a bit with Venu's patches.

I also soon hope to see patches to:
* Convert the Tegra USB and PHY drivers from the vbus-gpios DT property
  to the new vbus-supply regulator. This will affect both drivers, and
  I really hope will happen soon.
* Add support for Tegra30 and Tegra114 SoCs. I expect this would touch
  both the USB and PHY drivers. This may or may not happen in 3.11.

As such, there will be quite a lot of interaction between the Tegra USB
and PHY drivers in 3.10. I'll let you decide if it's better for them to
go through the main USB tree or the USB PHY tree, and hence who should
pull in this pull request.

Tag description:

The Tegra USB bindings were in bad shape. The patches in this branch
fix the binding definitions, and make all the necessary additions to
the DT files. Stale nodes/properties will be removed early in 3.12
once the USB driver has been updated for the new binding.

These changes are needed in both the USB tree, to allow the driver to
be updated to handle them, and the Tegra tree, so that various tree-
wide DT changes (e.g. conversion of IRQ/GPIO/clock constants to defines)
can be applied on top of them.
