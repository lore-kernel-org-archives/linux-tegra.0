So this seems to be the opposite of what Santosh was saying. By
definition, if you're talking about platform-specific knowledge, surely
you are /not/ talking about common code. If you /are/ talking about
common code that enables the WARs based on some data that was created by
the kernel before it power-saved, then that's exactly what Peter was
proposing, so I don't understand Santosh's "not maintainable" comment...

Item (2) below I assume is intended only to address the
CPU0-on-first-boot issue. Any code that "wraps" (is prepended to?) the
kernel isn't part of the kernel, and hence won't be available for the
kernel to use when bringing up CPUn, or when resuming from power save,
since the whole point is the kernel doesn't even know that code exists,
right?
