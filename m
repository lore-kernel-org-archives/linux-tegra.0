I see several obstacles with this approach:

1) update_devfreq() is a governor private function (defined in=20
drivers/devfreq/governor.h) and it would need to be called from the=20
device profile.

2) devfreq events (start monitoring, stop monitoring, suspend, resume,=20
=2E..) are processed by the governor. So it would still need access to =
the=20
actmon registers to honor these requests.

3) simple monitors like performance and powersave set the frequency (ma=
x=20
or min) once and for all when they are started, and don't need to be=20
called again afterwards. But this is probably what will happen if you=20
let the devfreq_dev_profile handle the ACTMON registers, since it can=20
make no assumption on when the governor expects to be invoked.

It would be good to have the feedback of devfreq's maintainers about=20
this (added them). How could an IP capable of monitoring activity=20
through counters and firing interrupts when these counters reach a=20
certain threshold be integrated nicely into devfreq? The functions seem=
=20
to overlap between the governor (reacting to specific events, in this=20
case ACTMON interrupts) and dev_profile (querying current status throug=
h=20
the counters), and it seems difficult to come with a design where the=20
governor and dev_profile are not tightly intertwined.
