Yes, please make them proper functions. The proper place for them is chip.c

So you need a CONFIG_PM variant and stubs which return 0 for the !PM case.

That leaks the module refcount.

Which is a no no, as you might lose interrupts that way. We disable interrupts
lazy, i.e. we do not mask them. So no, you cannot do that from
enable/disable_irq().

enable_irq_lazy is a misnomer. enable_irq_pm or such might be acceptable.

But before we go there I really want to see a proper use case for such
functions.
