Unfortunately, get_maintainer.pl has helped me too much and this series
got blocked by some mailing lists due to the large amount of recipients.
Following versions will be sent to the previous audience + the
linux-watchdog list.
For context, the full series (including previous versions) can be found
on lore at

True, that is a bit out of context. Especially considering you did not
receive any other messages of that series.
Defining a namespace a symbol should be exported to can be done in
different ways. All of them effectively change the EXPORT_SYMBOL*
macro's behaviour. The method I am referring to is using

  ccflags-y += -DDEFAULT_SYMBOL_NAMESPACE=WATCHDOG_CORE

directly in drivers/watchdog/Makefile. Since this would also apply the
namespace to exports in non-core modules it would be incorrect. Thus I
used the method of applying the namespace directly by changing the
EXPORT_SYMBOL macro expansion.

One intention of this patch series is to make exporting and using of
namespaces explicit. As such, the subsystem exporting symbols is
defining the namespace it exports to and the module using a namespace is
supposed to explicitly declare its usage via import. In case of watchdog
(and probably other cases) it might make sense to find a way to
implicitly import the namespace for in-tree drivers in the same area.

This very patch is an RFC to demonstrate how Symbol Namespaces would be
used based on the current implementation (the other RFC as part of this
series is for the introduction of the namespace USB_STORAGE).
WATCHDOG_CORE serves as one of two examples. I do not think the two RFC
patches should be merged along with this series.

Completely agree. This is just an RFC that omits these details as it
purely focuses on the introduction and consequences of such a namespace
to demonstrate how the feature works.

I understand the point. Especially as I am already now affected by the
long list of recipients when sending this patch. The problem with single
patches here is, that once a symbol is exported into a namespace, all
modules using it have to declare that import to avoid a warning at
compile time and module load time. Hence the all-in-one approach.
Luckily, the patch series also provides a way to address such a warning
(via `make nsdeps`) that creates the necessary source code fix as a
single line per module and namespace right after MODULE_LICENSE(). That
is how this patch was created in the first place.

Cheers,
Matthias
