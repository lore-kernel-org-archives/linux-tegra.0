For the furthur info, GART occupies 1 block within MC register range,
and SMMU occupies 3 blocks. In both Tegra{20,30}, MC driver only uses
MC registers, GART uses GART registers in its own block, and SMMU uses
SMMU registers in its own blocks *exclusively*.

IRQ is handled in MC. They include IOMMU page access fault too, but
MC ISR just prints fault address and other info. IRQ handling
registers belong to MC, and GART/SMMU doesn't have to touch it.

 Tegra20:
 	7000f000-7000f3ff : /mc@7000f000	1KB
 	  7000f024-7000f02f : gart
 
 Tegra30:
 	7000f000-7000f3ff : /mc@7000f000	1KB
 	  7000f010-7000f03b : smmu, register block 1
 	  7000f1f0-7000f1ff : smmu, register block 2
 	  7000f228-7000f283 : smmu, register block 3
 	  ....

GART/SMMU register offsets are defined in TRM from the beginning of
MC(0x7000f000), instead of the beginning of their block(s). I think
that 'ioremap()' is done by unit of 4KB in the end because of MMU
address translation, and it's ok that SMMU/GART ioremap's 4KB from
0x7000f000.

From their functionality POV, MC and IOMMU(GART/SMMU) drivers are
totally independent. Those drivers can be kept independent, except
register offset(0x7000f000) in TRM.

Can "request_resource(mc_resource, gart_resource)" or
"insert_resource(mc_resource, gart_resource)" create the following
resource tree?

 Tegra20:
 	7000f000-7000f3ff : /mc@7000f000	1KB
 	  7000f024-7000f02f : gart

gart/smmu may be able to get the parent resources for ioremap()?

+	mc = pdev->dev.parent->of_node;
  or
+	res = platform_get_resource(to_platform_device(pdev->dev.parent), IORESOURCE_MEM, 0);

Option 4:

GART/SMMU only needs MC register range(resource). Their register
blocks are statically exclusively accessed although they are located
within MC register range. GART/SMMU and MC are quite independent from
functionarity/driver POV. So if we can ignore the exact H/W module
connections, what about the following info being provided?

	mc: mc@7000f000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-mc";
		reg = <0x7000f000 0x400>;	/* controller registers */
		interrupts = <0 77 0x04>;
	};

	gart: gart {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-gart";
		reg = <0x7000f024 0xc   /* controller registers */
		               ^^^^^^
		       0x58000000 0x02000000>; /* GART aperture */
		mc = &mc;
		^^^^^^^^^ 
	};

GART driver can get MC register range by phandle "mc", and make its
reservation as child of "mc". "GART aperture" just goes straight
because it's also visible to CPU. We could keep those drivers mostly
independent if DT allows this kind of phandle.
