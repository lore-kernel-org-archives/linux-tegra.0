Because the mbox client has no idea to know which hsb sub-module to bind 
with. However, the way you suggested below should solve my concern and 
back-ward compatible indeed.

Ah, yes. I think the U-Boot doesn't need to deal with the multiple HSP 
sub-module supporting issue, and the binding I purposed was more 
complicate for that. The idea with "#mbox-cells=<1>" and 
"mboxes=<(type<<16)|id>" is fine with me. I will revise the hsp driver 
for this.
