That doesn't feel right to me.  Device characteristics are normally
communicated via "capabilities" registers, not programmed by the OS in
"control" registers.  The OS needs to be able to configure arbitrary
plug-in devices without having device-specific details built into it.

Sec 7.33.3 says:

  LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD_Value – Along with the LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD_Scale,
  this field indicates the LTR threshold used to determine if entry
  into L1 results in L1.1 (if enabled) or L1.2 (if enabled).  The
  default value for this field is 00 0000 0000b.

which does not actually say anything about the L1.2 entry/exit time.

The L0s and L1 exit latencies are read-only fields in the Link
Capabilities register.  I don't completely understand how they work,
but I think corresponding L1.2 exit latency information is reported
via the "Port T(POWER_ON)" and "Port T(COMMON_MODE)" fields in the L1
PM Substates Capabilities register.  These are HwInit fields and sec
5.5.4 says they depend on circuit components and AC coupling
capacitors.

What does Tegra report for Port T(POWER_ON) and Port T(COMMON_MODE)?
It looks like the current lspci should decode everything in the L1 PM
Substates capability:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/pciutils/pciutils.git/tree/ls-ecaps.c#n584
Can you collect that output?

I notice that the L1 PM SS Capabilities register contains "Port
T(POWER_ON)" and the Control 2 register contains the "T(POWER_ON)".
The spec says "Port T(POWER_ON)" is what this port requires of the
opposite end of the link, so apparently we should be configuring
"T(POWER_ON)".  We don't touch that, which looks like a hole in the
current code.

I don't think the root port itself has a latency requirement.  The
*endpoints* provide functionality that may be latency sensitive.  The
OS needs to configure the path between the root port and the endpoint
in such a way that we can satisfy the endpoint's requirements.

I'm still interested in this part of my question.  I'm willing
to apply patches 2, 3, 4 (in the order 4, 3, 2 and omitting the
pcie_aspm_get_ltr_l_1_2_threshold() part of patch 3) even if we
haven't figured out patch 1.

If we did this much, we should be able to use lspci to manually
compute what we think *should* happen and use setpci to set the
LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD and see if it works as expected.
