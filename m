The cpu_to_csr_reg macro was defined in "sleep.h". I was used to
translate the bit offset of CPU number in CSR register. The code here
was used for CPU0 on Tegra30 only before. Because the Tegra114 had more
advance CPU power control. Each Core need run through here when power
gate resume.

No, I had verified on Tegra20, Tegra30 and Tegra114 of this series.

It clear the some extensions for CPU power control on Tegra114.
