Mostly consistency.  Most of the experience we have with the flattened
device tree up to this point hasn't bothered with the 'status'
property.  It is only when AMP and hypervisors cam online that it
became important to use a status property, and that only when the
kernel needs to be told that the device does indeed exist, but it must
not be touched.  I'd like to continue that pattern for new DT users
with the default assumption that a device is enabled unless the board
=2Edts explicitly disables it.
