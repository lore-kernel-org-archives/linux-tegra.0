I think this needs some investigation. As a general policy, we should
not grow the kernel image size when moving from a traditional ARM
platform to an ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM one.

This is somewhat contradicted by how we already require CONFIG_OF
to be set for multiplatform kernels, and that adds around 80kb
to the image size.

Looking at just the defconfig files, these are the ones that currently
do not set CONFIG_PM:

build/acs5k_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/acs5k_tiny_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/axm55xx_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/bcm2835_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/clps711x_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/ebsa110_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/footbridge_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/ks8695_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/netwinder_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/rpc_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/u300_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set
build/vf610m4_defconfig/.config:# CONFIG_PM is not set

The only ones among these are are actually multiplatform are axm55xx,
bcm2835, and u300. I see no downsides of force-enabling PM for
any of those, so we could decide to 'select PM' from
CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.

The one usecase where we may want to have a modern machine without
CONFIG_PM is a minimal MACH_VIRT kernel for running in a virtual
machine or QEMU with minimal memory requirements, e.g. trying to
squeeze a large number of guests on a single host system.
