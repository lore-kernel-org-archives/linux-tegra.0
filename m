I've re-checked the driver and it is fine, PLL_X disabling is expected on a
switching parent clock to PLL_P as for the target frequency. This patch isn't
needed, please scratch it.

It occurred to me that the driver could be improved further a tad while I was
performing the re-check, hence likely there will be couple more patches from me.
