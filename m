Maybe I wasn't entirely clear -- I was proposing to include this in
the next batch of fixes for 3.18 so that the aliases processing code
can go in for 3.19. If we hold this until the merge window we run the
risk of having largeish parts of the merge window unbisectable (more
than if we merge this as part of the next/dt contents).

I was envisioning the former, but the latter would work OK too.
