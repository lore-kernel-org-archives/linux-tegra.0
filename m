Going through clock driver, the clk_get() should return error pointer or 
valid pointer, atleast not NULL.

Probably our clock driver is returning to NULL and hence issue is 
becasue whole world, it  check for IS_ERR or !IS_ERR() and null clk 
pointer treated as !IS_ERR().

Stephen,
Which is the tree on which Prashant changes are applied. I can debug 
from that tree.
