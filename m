I can accept that saving kernel stack space is a good reason to use 
pointers. And since as you below mentioned, there is no line length 
issue, I'll change this.

Good point. I usually never use this style, so I didn't think of doing 
it like that. But it is clearly the best solution.

Yes, might be.
