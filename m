The "generic" platform bus device is not a "known parent".  I don't
understand the difference between just setting the parent to be NULL,
which will then have a "proper" parent pointer filled in by the driver
core when the device is registered, or faking it out here.  What is the
difference?

In the end, the device always ends up with a parent pointer, right?
