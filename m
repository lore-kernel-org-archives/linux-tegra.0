I /could/ rebase it but then I wouldn't be able to produce the patch
sets/patches for others [*] (such as the Novena project) to derive
their kernel tree from my iMX6 patch set.

What I'd prefer is to keep the patch set intact, and provide Chris
with a pull request for it up to patch 33, which would need a
conflict fixed - and this would mean that I can be sure that what
I'm testing, and what I'm distributing is what Chris will also be
submitting.

* - this currently stands at 230 patches in all - mmc + l2c + fec +
    imx-drm + other iMX6 changes.
