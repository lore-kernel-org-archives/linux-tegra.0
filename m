Hi Thierry,

I have a couple more questions, probably just because I'm
DT-illiterate.

I had a little trouble disambiguating this from the "Required
properties on Tegra124 and later (deprecated)" line above.  It might
help if they said:

  Required PCIe controller properties on Tegra124 and later (deprecated):
  Required PCIe Root Port properties for Tegra124 and later:

I'm not sure how to interpret the "deprecated" part.  Assume I'm
writing a DTS.  What am I supposed to include?

  - "phys" and "phy-names" under the PCIe controller *and*
    "phys" and "phy-names" under the Root Port?

  - "phys" and "phy-names" under the PCIe controller only if I don't
    supply "phys" and "phy-names" under the Root Port?

My guess is that a board with more than one PHY for PCIe should omit
"phys" and "phy-names" under the PCIe controller and include them
under each Root Port.  And a board with only one PHY could conceivably
supply these properties either under the controller or the Root Port
or both.

I'm also a little confused here because it looks like this root port
supports two lanes, but there's only one entry in phy-names.  I
thought you needed one entry for each lane.
