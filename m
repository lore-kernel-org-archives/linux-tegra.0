Why do we need another API ?

Why not remove the present persistent API and rely on the SUSPEND_NONSTOP flag
to do the right action at suspend and resume?

We register different clocksources, the rating does the selection.

When entering 'suspend', we check against the SUSPEND_NONSTOP flag and switch
to the first clocksource with the best rating and the flag set. When resuming,
we switch back to the highest rating.

Having a clocksource out of the always-on domain must be notified with a trace
in the log because this is not a normal situation.
