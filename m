The patch

   ASoC: wm9712: fix replace codec to component

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: wm9712: fix replace codec to component

Since commit 143b44845d87 ("ASoC: wm9712: replace codec to component")
"wm9712-codec" got renamed to "wm9712-component", however, this change
never got propagated down to the actual board/platform drivers. E.g. on
Colibri T20 this lead to the following spew upon boot with sound/touch
being broken:

[    2.214121] tegra-snd-wm9712 sound: ASoC: CODEC DAI wm9712-hifi not registered
[    2.222137] tegra-snd-wm9712 sound: snd_soc_register_card failed (-517)

...
[   14.970443] ALSA device list:
[   14.996628]   No soundcards found.

This commit finally fixes this again.
