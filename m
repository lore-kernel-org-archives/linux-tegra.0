For IMX, CMD38 responds very quick since it does not wait for TC interrupt
when DAT0 de-assertion due to IP limitation.

Maybe one better way may be using polling for status if erase timeout
is bigger than
host capability, else still prefer to use hw timeout mechanism instead
to save CPU.
However, then we have two issues:
1) not waiting for R1B seems a bit violation with standard spec.
Also it increase complexity on handling the R1B of the same command
for two different
cases: using hw timeout or polling status for CMD38.

2) In current implementation, the data size to erase will not exceed
the max_discard_bytes
which is calculated based on max_discard_to of host.
Then how do we specify max_discard_to if want to use polling? UNIT_MAX?
Will it be too long to affect other activities in the same system?
