To be honest, I feel the opposite; random blank lines sprinkled in the
middle of related code make the code structure harder to follow.

The slave ID seems channel-specific to me, and hence should be managed
at the channel level. struct dma_slave_config is the client-specified
runtime properties. As you mention, I also worry about client drivers
trampling over the dma_slave_config data, so storing it where they
can't doesn't seem like a good idea.

It's a HW specific detail, I think. At least, the representation of
the data in a DT binding is, and hence so is the parsing of the data
from DT. The rest of the code that's in the driver re: slave ID is
trivial enough it doesn't seem worth sharing. And in fact, once this
series is done, we can even remove the conditional assignments to
slave_id and require that it be provided by DT and never from
dma_slave_config, which simplifies it even further.

That'd probably be possible, yes, given a few extra fields in struct
dma_device, e.g. for the of_xlate function pointer. As you say, I
won't address it in this patch though.
