> +Tegra SoC DFLL PWM controller

Does this exist on Tegra124 as well? The reason why I ask is that the
file name should usually contain the name of the first SoC generation
that contains an IP block described by the binding. I'm not sure we've
ever clarified whether it is supposed to be the first chip where a
compatible IP block was introduced or where we've made use of it in the
Linux kernel. I think it's usually the latter, but technically the
former would be more correct (since DT describes hardware, not on OS
implementation for said hardware).

Stephen, we have in the past used tegra124 in names, even if the IP was
already included in tegra114, but we never supported it on Tegra114 and
hence couldn't even verify that the binding was valid. Any preference as
to the name in this particular case?

I think it would be more idiomatic to describe this the other way
around. That is, describe in the clock-names property what each entry
means, then the clocks property can simply say must contain one entry
for each entry in clock-names.

> +- pwm-regulator: phandle to PWM regulator for using this PWM controller.

Why do we need the back link? I'd expect the regulator to be simply a
user of the PWM. Why do we need to access the regulator from the PWM?
I'm not sure (yet) how you've solved this in the driver, but it seems
like you've just created a circular dependency, which is usually not
good at all.

Here again I think you need to specify what names are expected in the
pinctrl-names property and then pinctrl-N should be described as
representing the phandle to the pinmux state for the Nth entry in
pinctrl-names.

The TRM denotes this block as DVFS and in fact on Tegra124 we've added
an entry that exposes this as clock@70110000 and with a different
compatible: nvidia,tegra124-dfll.

I'd like to understand how this works. The DFLL binding suggests that
this PWM mode is supported on Tegra124 as well, so I'm presuming that
Tegra210 has pretty much the same IP and supports both I2C and PWM
modes.

Does this binding then effectively replace the nvidia,tegra124-dfll one
and uses the IP block in some different mode?

"enable" and "disable" should be enough, since these are scoped within
the pwm_dfll node anyway.

If these are simple bits you should leave away the 0x prefix. 0x prefix
suggests that it is one particular value of a multi-bit field.

struct pwm_chip already has a struct device *dev member, perhaps reuse
that instead of keeping another copy?

Try to avoid this global variable, please.

I prefer the offset to be unsigned int, otherwise it might be mistaken
for a register value (because of the explicit width). Also I find it
easier to read if offs here...

and val here are spelled out as offset and value.

Any particular reason why you use __raw_*() accessors here?

Why is this required?

Huh? How come this doesn't need to be implemented?

dev_info() is a little strong here, don't you think?

Same here. This is debugging information and should at most be dev_dbg()
if anything at all.

I don't get why you need to export these symbols as custom API. Why not
simply make this part of the ->enable() and ->disable() implementations?

That's completely backwards, isn't it? Isn't the regulator using this
very PWM to control the voltage? Would args.np not always be the same as
tdpc->dev->of_node?

You may want to provide at least some information about how many cells
you expect.

Again, this is much too verbose.

This should be the very last thing you do. pwmchip_add() will otherwise
make the PWM chip available to all users in the system and keep it
around even if any of the below fails. You could always remove it again
on failure, but then why go through the trouble of registering something
that you may fail to set up?

You should put the name of a real person here. It's meant as contact
information if anyone wants to contact the author about issues with the
driver, so ideally it'd include an email address as well.
