Yes it does, thanks!

Technically, the only other place this could occur is in
sdhci_request_done() because this also calls ->set_clock() with the
spinlock held. However, this is only called if
SDHCI_QUIRK_CLOCK_BEFORE_RESET is set, which is only currently true for
a device in sdhci-pci-core.c and this one just uses the normal
sdhci_set_clock() routine.
