We do need a fallback. I think it would be as simple as the following:

  	np = of_find_matching_node(NULL, matches);
- 	BUG_ON(!np);
+ 	if (!np) {
+ 		base_addr = 0x60007000;
+ 		iomap(base_addr) // roughly this anyway

In other words, hard-code the fallback right where it's used. No need to
keep iomap.h around etc.

It might make sense to call the function as early as possible; don't
some of CPU reset, powergate, hotplug depend on the flow controller? Not
that they can likely trigger this early, but it'd still be good if the
init order roughly logically followed any runtime dependencies.
