That seems totally doable indeed. Actually the right way to do this
might be by extending the simple DPI panel driver Laurent included in
his patchset.

Just out of curiosity, why don't we rather define

compatible="chunghwa,claa101wa01a", "simple-panel"

in that order? I thought DT compatible strings should go from more to
less specific. The device would still bind to "simple-panel" if no
more specific driver exists.

How about making all regulators and GPIO optional in the driver?

Excellent. Thanks for the feedback.
