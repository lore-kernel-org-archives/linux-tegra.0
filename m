Thanks Jon for reviving this thread. I ran into the issue of having to
support multiple powerdomains for a single device again while working with
Viresh's 'domain performance state' patches [1], to add support for corners
on qualcomm platforms.
We do have devices which have logic and memory powered via separate rails,
and the drivers would want to set 'performance states' on both, which an
external core then translates into actual uV and programs the PMIC.
