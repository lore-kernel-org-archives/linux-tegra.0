The important point that I have struggled to explain is that right now
for downstreams to influence the order in which devices are probed,
they have to carry a substantial amount of patches that cannot be ever
upstreamed. This fiddling with initcall levels and link order means
changing files that are very frequently changing, increasing the
amount of work when rebasing and increasing the probability of
regressions after a rebase.

This just adds up to other shortcomings of mainline and ends up with
the net result of vendors getting stuck with 3.4 kernels on SoCs that
start production in 2015. Another consequence is that vendors don't
have a chance to upstream their stuff even if they cared. The
overarching goal of the project I'm in is to reduce those shortcomings
that downstreams have to workaround, to facilitate their involvement
upstream.

With this series, the order in which devices are probed becomes the
order in which they were registered, which is the order in which the
devices appear in the FW description of the hw or in the board files
(much more predictable, which makes for a more robust process). For DT
and board files, which cover a good part of the consumer devices
shipped today with Linux, the downstream could just change the order
of device nodes and get their display or whatever to probe before any
other devices.

And even if downstream's hw has a SoC .dtsi that exists in mainline,
they could add a step to their build process that automatically
reorders the nodes to avoid carrying changes to that DT fragment.

But that's moot currently because Greg believes that the time spent
probing devices at boot time could be reduced enough so that the order
in which devices are probed becomes irrelevant. IME that would have to
be under 200ms so that the user doesn't notice and that's unicorn-far
from any bootlog I have ever seen.

Given that downstreams are already carrying as many hacks as they
could think of to speed total boot up, I think this is effectively
telling them to go away.

Sorry for the rant,
