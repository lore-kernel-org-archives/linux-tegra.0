OK, that's fine then.

Well, the patches do touch the CPU reset vector and related code. That's
shared with hotplug, right? But anyway, it turns out the CPU hotplug is
not related to the issue; the system acts strangely even without/before
performing any hotplug. I just hadn't noticed that before.

Yes, having a USB device plugged in does affect the issue. In summary:

next-20130716, with or without USB devices plugged in: Works fine.

next-20130716 with your patches, without USB device plugged in:
Occasional short problems (detailed below).

next-20130716 with your patches, with USB device plugged in: Continual
long problems (detailed below).

The testing I did was to log in over the serial console, hit <enter>
around five times, and watch the shell prompt echo back, then type
"ls<enter" and watch the (directory listing appear (I have about 20
files in my directory, with long-ish names), then repeat. With plain
next-20130716, this is nice and fast and there are no pauses. With your
patches applied, there are occasional or continual pauses, which last
for either a short time (tenths of a second), or even a second or two,
both depending on whether a USB device is plugged in or not.

I believe this is the same issue I saw when I applied your patches to
the Tegra tree on top of v3.11-rc1.

So, either your patch causes a bug, or exposes some pre-existing bug.
Either way, I can't apply them because they cause a regression.

I wonder if this is at all related to NVIDIA bug 1286857 "Upstreaming
task: Enabling LP2 causes slow serial console"? I tried the WAR there:

echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state1/disable
echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cpuidle/state1/disable

... and the system locked up solid very soon after; I had just enough
time to type "ls<enter>", then it locked up. Again, performing those
same echos on next-20130716 without your patches works fine.
