There is no multiplexing on the producer/device side (i.e. what this 
driver does). The mailbox specified in device tree specifies the stream 
we send stuff to. The mailboxes are per-CPU (we use the CCPLEX mailbox 
here), so it cannot really be changed.

The consumer then sees the multiplexing in that it can receive from and 
transmit to all of the various CPUs in the system at the same time. AIUI 
there is also a secondary form of multiplexing where the outputs of 
different VMs can be multiplexed by the hypervisor, but I'm not very 
familiar with that.
