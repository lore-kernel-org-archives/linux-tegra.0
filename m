I agree, there might be some small numbers that this is a problem for,
and if so, great, show us the boot logs where things are taking up all
of the time, and we can work on resolving those issues.

But without hard numbers / details, this all is just random hand-waving,
and I don't like making core kernel changes on that basis.  And no one
else should ever want us to do that either.
