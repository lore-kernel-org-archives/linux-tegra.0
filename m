No, the binding only describes direct relationships between the IOMMU
and masters. There's no way to translate them inbetween or inherit them.

I'm wondering how this could be described in device tree, though.
Perhaps something like this:

	iommu {
		#iommu-cells =3D <1>;
	};

	bridge {
		iommus =3D <&/iommu 42>;
		#iommu-cells =3D <0>;

		device@0 {
			iommus =3D <&/bridge>;
		};

		device@1 {
			iommus =3D <&/bridge>;
		};

		...
	};

? That way some code could walk up the IOMMU tree to resolve this. Or
perhaps even easier:

	iommu {
		#iommu-cells =3D <1>;
	};

	bridge {
		iommus =3D <&/iommu 42>;

		device@0 {
			...
		};

		device@1 {
			...
		};

		...
	};

And we could enhance the binding by defining that the iommus node is
inherited by devices on a bus, which by what you're saying would be the
sensible thing to do anyway.

In the second example above, the presence of an iommus property in the
bridge would indicate that it's non-transparent regarding IOMMU
translation and therefore the master ID should be inherited. Devices
could still override by providing their own iommus property, though I'd
be a little surprised if there ever was hardware like that.

Evidently you know much better what the requirements are here and what
will actually be required. I guess we'll need to have more discussions
along with examples of use-cases.
