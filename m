I want to provide this function originally. But I found the
tegra_cpu_disable() was removed recently. It was replaced by the common
cpu_disable() function that didn't allow CPU0 to be un-plugged.

But I had verified the CPU0 is OK to be un-plugged on the older
linux-next branch that tegra_cpu_disable() watn't removed yet.

Do you want me to add them back to support this function for Tegra114?

Thanks,
Joseph
