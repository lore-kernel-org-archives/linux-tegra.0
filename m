Thanks!

It's exactly this GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH that is wrong. It should have been
active low since the signal is active high from the charger, but inverted
on its way to the gpio pin, so from the gpio point of view the signal
is active-low.

What a mess, the only thing that is right is the bindings. It says that the
gpio is active when AC is present, which makes perfect sense and matches the
name of the property.

Then all the Tegra dts users violate that and say active-high when in fact
the signal is inverted on the path to the pin, so should have been active-low.

Then the driver code "saves the day" for the Tegra users by reversing the
inversion in the signal-path, but that is of course only helping Tegra and
and others not following the dt specification.

How is that helping? It's no different that just saying active-low for
boards that do not invert ACOK (which is what I currently do in my dts,
but I hate doing it since it doesn't match dt docs and is therefore just
wrong).

I suspect that at the end of the day documentation is less important than
regressions. But if there are more than one implementation of the same
spec and Linux is not following it, it's kind of harsh to change the spec
to match Linux. I doubt that there are any other users in this case though,
but what do I know?

I'll send a patch re-documenting ti,ac-detect-gpios to specify AC absence
instead of AC presence, let's see what the dt people thinks...
