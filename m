That's kind of implied by the structure of the binding. The first is in
the section dedicated to the description of the host bridge controller,
whereas the second in in the section for root port properties. Granted,
the format for device tree bindings isn't very rich, so this isn't very
easy to spot. Perhaps something like this could help:

	NVIDIA Tegra PCIe controller

	The top-level device tree node describes the host bridge
	controller and properties listed therein apply to the controller
	as a whole.

	Required properties:
	...

	Root Ports:
	-----------

	Root ports are defined as subnodes of the PCIe controller node.

	Required properties:
	...

Would that help clarify?

Whatever is marked as deprecated should not be used in new bindings at
all. That is, new board files should move to per-lane PHYs, no matter
how many lanes they enable.

The XUSB pad controller that provides these PHYs can be driven by two
different drivers: a pinctrl driver that exposes a single PHY for all
PCI lanes (it uses per-lane nvidia,iddq properties to enable or disable
each of the lanes) or a PHY driver that exposes one PHY per lane. Each
PHY can separately be powered on.

Perhaps a better approach would be to simply remove the deprecated
properties to avoid any possible confusion. It does have the drawback
that old device trees won't have a documentation counterpart.

Not necessarily. I'm not sure if the wording in the description makes it
clear, but there are a limited number of configurations that the root
ports support. However the ports may not want (or need) to drive all of
the lanes that they support. Consider for example one possible
configuration on Tegra124, which is to have one root port operate in x1
mode and the other in x2 mode. The x2 port may have a fixed card wired
to it (onboard) that is x1. Enabling the second lane would be wasting
power because it is never used.
