I agree we should have the tegra132- variants, even if we don't know how
different the blocks happen to be from their predecessors. So please
don't drop them.

It would just be nice to dump the strings in binding docs so as to not
have checkpatch complaints.

I appreciate it's a bit of a pain, but once we allow it we're stuck with
it forever, so I'd prefer that we fix these known binding issues first.
