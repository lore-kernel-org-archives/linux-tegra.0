Each of the root ports has a PCI-compatible set of configuration
registers, so I guess what is meant is that the apertures a programmed
according to the PCI bridge specification.

I think DT support for PCI is lacking in a lot of areas. PowerPC seems
to be the only architecture actively setting up busses according to the
bus-range property specified in the DT. All other architectures seem to
not pre-allocate bus apertures and go with the default instead. From
what you say that means hot-plugging is out. Although I don't think the
Tegra PCIe controller even supports hot-plugging.

Since this is pretty well specified by PCIe, a generic implementation
should be possible. We'll have to wait for some better documentation on
Tegra to know whether this is actually ECAM or not.
