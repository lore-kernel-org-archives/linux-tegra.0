If changes implemented by the clock driver are trashing the regulator
settings I would expect the clock driver to be responsible for fixing
things up rather than another driver that happens to use the clock.  I'd
also expect some kind of internal documentation explaining what's going
on, and possibly=20

This *is* the sort of thing _sync() is intended for, though it's mainly
expected to be used in cases like suspend where things have been powered
off.  As you can see from the code it's based on the settings that
software made, but then if nothing in software has any need to configure
anything then why do we even care that the hardware changed anything?

Setting the voltage you've read back sounds broken, if the hardware
might randomly change things how do you know the settings we read were
sane?  Shouldn't we know what voltage range the device requires in a
given mode and set that - that's much more normal?
