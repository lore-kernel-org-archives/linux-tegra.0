I like this idea.
We may extend the sdio_device_id to contain a compatible string,
then sdio core is responsible to pass the corresponding device node to the
sdio function driver once a match device found, this is sdio function independent.
The sdio function driver then are responsible to parse the device node to
fetch the needed information like reset-gpios and enable-gpios to do correct
initialization sequence.

However, one known question for this model is that some WiFi may need reset the chip
via gpio first before being able to be enumerated.
Then this model may not work for such devices since it can not enumerate this device
before completing the sdio function specific initialization, neither passing node to its
driver.
(i'm not sure this is a correct behavior since per my understanding, the sdio io function
(function 1-7) specific initialization should not affect the normal sdio common function
(function 0) enumeration, but i did not find a clear definition in sdio spec.
Anyone see such real devices?)

Then for such devices, that is definitely a problem.
If the sdio function specific initialization affects the normal enumeration,
then it definitely need to be put into sdio core as an interface like sdio_prepare before the
enumeration.
But it seems not reasonable since we did not know prepare for which sdio device
before the sdio device enumeration completes.
Maybe the possible solution is still do it in platform specific code via
of_machine_is_compatible(....).

For your question that user may plug multi types of sdio device with difference
gpio using,
did we see such a real device that the pluggable sdio devices need
some extra gpio to work? I did not meet it before.
If it real exists, can we rather consider it an integrated sdio devices on board?
Then we can only define the integrated sdio device node on board under sdio controller.

Maybe no.
These things are board specific and should be put in board dts file.
If really using the same gpios by chance, then add them for each board may
be reasonable.

That seems should be cared by the corresponding WiFi function driver
rather than the binding itself no matter which is plugged in.
The binding just pass the node to driver, then everything else is driver
specific. Is that reasonable?
