I have to second the concern; but for a different reason.  This
shouldn't even remotely be necessary.  If the pin is used as an
interrupt, then interrupt controller driver (which I would assume is
also the gpio controller driver) should be responsible for setting up
the pin so that it can be used correctly as a irq line.  Why does the
gpio number need to be explicitly passed?
