To save others the time, the relevant x86 commit is:

  b13b1d2d8692b437 ("x86/mm: In the PTE swapout page reclaim case clear the accessed bit instead of flushing the TLB")

That does call out the fact that this means page aging will be imprecise, and
hot pages might be reclaimed, with the claim being that the chance of this is
relatively low.

Do we have any numbers for other workloads?

As with the x86 commit, we should comment why we're not flushing the TLB here.

Thanks,
Mark.
