Only that for arm64 we try to do things slightly differently and not
because we just like to but because we want better standardisation
across SoCs. One example is the booting protocol. Another example, you
don't get some early initcalls for your SoC (no machine descriptor). The
hardware should be configured by firmware in such a way that it boots at
least up to arch_initcall() level (ideally, we should move anything to
device_initcall() but it's not always easy).

It's not about whether you are a fan of it or not but whether we can get
more code sharing across several SoCs and not just between tegra arm32
and arm64 versions.
