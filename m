Yes. I did try it with Exynos (after the rework). And there weren't
any regressions.

To be precise - do you refer to of_cpufreq_cooling_register() [1] or
cpufreq_cooling_register() [2]?

For the latter [2] - drivers like imx_thermal.c are fully prepared for
-EDEFER_PROBE.

For the former [1] - only cpufreq-dt.c uses it (and Exynos SoC after
the rework).

I assume, that you mean case [1]?

Could you share the exact SoC/board/_defconfig setup to reproduce this
behavior? I possess Beagle Bone Black, but it doesn't have thermal
support (perhaps because its lack of accuracy).

With my Exynos setup I didn't experience any problems with this patch.

As I look into the cpufreq-dt.c driver - in the cpufreq_init()
function, the call to of_cpufreq_cooling_register() is performed just
before cpufreq_table_validate_and_show().
It looks like a mistake in the cpufreq-dt.c code.

Correct. Such _wrong_ behavior was the original motivation to prepare
this patch.

Unfortunately there is also a "window" in which the driver is not
properly configured and can cause system crash, although it is unlikely.

To be more precise - it will affect systems, which use of-thermal.c and
cpufreq-dt.c in the same time, due to wrong ordering in the latter file.

Could you give me a hint about the exact affected system? I've grep'ed
for CPUFREQ_DT in the ./arch/arm/configs with no success.

I will think about possible solution and refer to previous discussion.
