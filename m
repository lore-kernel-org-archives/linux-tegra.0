I've been wanting to clean up the Tegra .dts files for a little while.
Here's a set of changes to do so. Hopefully they don't seem to much
like churn.

I was thinking of putting them into a for-3.6/cleanup branch, but I
suppose I could put them into 3.5 at the end too. I'd need to base this
series on the result of merging Tegra's for-3.5/dt and
for-3.5/tegra30-audio branches. Olof, what are your thoughts here?

I've tested them on Cardhu so far, but still need to test all the other
boards to make sure I didn't introduce some typo.
