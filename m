Indeed.

Ah, sorry, didn't notice that while looking.

There is definitely space for some API improvement in the whole IOMMU 
domain memory allocation space. I would prefer keeping the IOMMU mapping 
and memory allocation separate, though, since otherwise we couldn't map 
the same physical memory into multiple domains (or have some memory that 
is temporarily not mapped into any.)

The issue seems to be non-trivial, so I'm fine with your RFC patch - it 
solves the issue and the double domain mapping thing is not a problem 
currently as we don't yet support IOMMU on T186. By the time we do 
support it I hope we'll have the new API or whatever replacement in place.
