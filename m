cpg_mssr_attach_dev() filters on clkspec.

As pm_clk_add_clks_of() has "_of" in the name (BTW, should it be called
of_pm_clk_add_clks()), I think passing the clkspec makes more sense than
passing a struct clk *.

OK. That way the caller can add more clocks if needed. I missed that case.

Given the above, your code is fine.

Thanks!
