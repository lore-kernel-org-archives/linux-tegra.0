An alternative would be to introduce to a frequency "base" the default
could be Hz (for backwards compatibility), but for CPUs we probably only
care about MHz (or may be kHz) and so 32-bits would still suffice. Even
if CPUs cared about Hz they could still use Hz, but in that case they
probably don't care about GHz. Obviously, we don't want to break DT
compatibility but may be the frequency base could be defined in DT and
if it is missing then Hz is assumed. Just a thought ...
