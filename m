Okay, thank you very much for the input. Let's put on hold these patches then.

Peter Geis just made a cpufreq driver for the Tegra30 and turned out it's just a
dozen lines of code that we'll have to add to the tegra20-cpufreq driver to
support Tegra30. The tegra20-cpufreq driver code suits very well for the Tegra30
integration, use of PLL_C for the intermediate scaling will make that
integration a bit messy. I'll return to considering of the different
transition-PLL variant after adding the Tegra30 support.
