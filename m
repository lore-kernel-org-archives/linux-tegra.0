Sorry, could you expand on this some more.

The whole point of these patches is that it's impossible to convert from
IRQ number to GPIO number.

Some drivers use just an IRQ, and don't care if it's a GPIO. They work
fine currently.

Some drivers use just a GPIO; that's not relevant to these patches.

Some drivers use something that's both an IRQ and a GPIO. Historically,
this has worked by passing the IRQ to the driver, and then the driver
calling irq_to_gpio() to get the GPIO ID. Since irq_to_gpio() is being
removed, this is no longer possible. The whole point of the removal was
that it's not possible in general to convert from IRQ to GPIO, so I'm not
sure exactly what you're proposing irq_configure() or gpiolib do to
centralize this?

Thanks for any insight.
