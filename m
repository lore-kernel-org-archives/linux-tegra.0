Yes, that's what should technically be present.

That won't work; the PMIC drivers don't enumerate sub-nodes as busss, so
 that clocks node won't ever be processed. Also, the PMIC drivers aren't
clock providers in most cases. It's not quite a correct representation
of the HW, but I would suggest simply creating a top-level "clock" node
for that fixed clock. If we ever have more top-level clocks, we can move
them into a top-level "clocks" node at that time.

Note: If there aren't already any other top-level clock nodes (which I
think is the case), the node can be named just "clock" rather than
"clock@0", since there are no naming conflicts.
