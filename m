The patch is huge, and it wasn't obvious (to me) from the diff context
what the non-lr jumps were doing.

Most, if not all, Cortex-A cores do this according the public TRMs.
They also do the same thing for "mov pc, lr" so there will probably be
no performance gain from this change.  It's still a good idea though,
since we don't know what future cores will do.

In that case the patch should be fine.  Your patch description didn't
make it clear that only actual returns were being changed.
