After trying to implement this I'm not so sure anymore that this is the best
approach. I think I'll have to play around with this some more to see what
fits best.

Okay, makes sense.

DTC has /incbin/ for that. Is arch/arm/boot/dts still the correct place for
EDID blobs? I could add tegra-medcom.edid if that's okay.
