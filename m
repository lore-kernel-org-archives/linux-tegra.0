When Trusted Foundations is detected as present on the system, but
Trusted Foundations support is not built into the kernel, the kernel
used to issue a panic very early during boot, leaving little clue to the
user as to what is going wrong.

It turns out that even without TF support built-in, the kernel can boot
on a TF-enabled system provided that SMP and cpuidle are disabled. This
patch does this and continue booting on one CPU, leaving the user with a
usable (however degraded) system.
