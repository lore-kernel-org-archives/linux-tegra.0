Apart from the randomness initialization, there are no users of
tegra_read_straps(). tegra_fuse_readl() is a new API, so that doesn't pose
any backwards-compatibility problems. The only bug I noticed when rereading
the code is that tegra_get_revision() reads the fuses on an A03 Tegra20 to
findout if it's A03 or A03p. This would obviously crash if the DT entries
are missing. I think this can be worked around by claiming it's an A03
in case the DT entries are missing. I don't think that will cause any problems?

Cheers,

Peter.
