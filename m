Yes (;-p). Please understand however that there are certain limitation 
if it comes to real-time clocks: The first one is the ultra low-power 
RTC available on the carrier board. The second one is PMIC integrated 
usually drawing much more current that the first dedicated one. The 
third one is Tegra SoC internal and won't keep the time across 
power-cycles in our design.

No SPI chip should ever get confused like that as long as they are chip 
select gated. At least by the traditional chip select meaning as opposed 
to NVIDIA's designers taking the term chip select a little too personal: 
they indeed only select a chip otherwise all the chip select pins are 
just left floating!

Good question and me and Stefan actually even talked about that 
yesterday. I am actually using KMS right now as follows:

video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720-16@60 video=LVDS-1:640x480-16@60'

So the panel node is purely used to hook up the back light part right now.

 From our point of view for our completely generic module approach where 
each customer potentially hooks up his own display make/model it would 
be desirable to have some way of defining such timings directly through 
the device tree.

You are right. It indeed does not make much sense as only V1.0a which 
never actually went on sale would be software incompatible.

Understood, however our Colibri standard defines a completely different 
order of the UARTs which is what we attempted to indicate by this aliases.
