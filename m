Ugh ... looks like I may have been a bit trigger happy with sending this
patch. I should not have removed the above line. However, it seems that
if I don't then the problem with the SD not initialising persists. So
this implies that something else is going on here with this particular
SD card. Furthermore, I have seen that another tegra30-beaver is
initialising the SD card fine on kernelci.org and it seems this is
working for Lucas too.

Plus in suspend I have not seen the mmc timeout warning that I was
seeing on tegra114/124 when they were failing. That also implies a
different problem.

Stephen, for your u-boot testing, do you are set the bit in the vendor
misc register to enable version 3.0 support for sdhci on tegra30? This
is what the above quirk is doing (and has done so for a very long time).

Sorry I am usually more thorough ...

Jon
