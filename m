I think the situation is a bit different here: It's less about the corner
cases for the SMMU, but about the question whether it makes more sense to
have the kernel figure out the settings, or have them come from DT
all the time.

As I said, I can't tell which approach is best here, but it sounds to
me we should either do dynamic configuration and get it right, or
hardcode the configuration it all the time if we can't.
