I noticed that yesterday's and today's -next were no longer booting on
one of our Tegra boards (Tegra210 Jetson TX2) because networking is
failing. The ethernet chip is a USB device and looking at the bootlogs I
can see that the Tegra XHCI driver is failing ...

 tegra-xusb 70090000.usb: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
 tegra-xusb 70090000.usb: HC died; cleaning up

The Tegra XHCI driver uses multiple power-domains and uses
device_link_add() to attach them. So now I am wondering if there is
something that we have got wrong in our implementation. However, I don't
see the device being probed deferred on boot or anything like that.

The driver in question is drivers/usb/host/xhci-tegra.c and we add the
links in the function tegra_xusb_powerdomain_init() which is before RPM
is enabled. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Cheers
Jon
