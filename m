OK, so I understand the addition to the DT defines which clients exist,
and hence which ASID-selection registers exist. This addition makes
sense to me.

What I don't quite understand is that change, but perhaps that's because
I'm not sure what that field meant before, and/or where the
client<->ASID mapping comes from.

Before this patch, did each client use that removed "u32 swgrp" to tell
the SMMU driver which ASID-selection register was used to configure it,
and then the SMMU took the union of all clients to know which
ASID-selection registers existed? If so, then perhaps this change makes
more sense than I thought... But, how does the SMMU driver know which of
the bits in the new nvidia,swgroups property is related to each struct
smmu_client?

Or, did the removed "u32 swgrp" indicate which of the SMMU's ASIDs
should be assigned to the client?

I guess what I'm missing is: How does the SMMU know which ASID to assign
to each client, either before or after this change? Or, does the driver
just assign every client to ASID 0 right now, and there's no provision
for separate ASIDs?
