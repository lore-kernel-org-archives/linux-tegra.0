Most likely it's either unnecessary, or insufficient.

Just for entering call SMC properly, it's not needed.  If the Secure
World has its MMU on and maps Normal World memory using the same memory
types as Linux, then the Normal World and Secure World access the memory
coherently with no extra barrier needed.

It the Secure World's MMU is off, or if it maps Normal World memory
as Secure (pagetable NS bit = 0), or if it maps Normal World memory with
memory types incompatible with the ones Linux is using then you will get
coherency problems: the Secure and Normal Worlds won't necessarily see
the same data.

In the latter case, you must do explicit cache maintenance around SMC
for the data you want to exchange.  This might also be needed in the
Secure World if caches are enabled over there.  DSB isn't enough by
itself.


If the Secure World doesn't access Normal World memory at all, you
don't need to do anything special and can remove the DSB.

Otherwise, for performance reasons, it is definitely preferable to have
the Secure World MMU on if possible, though it's a bit more complex to
set up.

Sure, but you could just add all the registers to the clobber list,
and then the compiler would save and restore them for you in the
function entry/exit sequences, which may be a bit more efficient.

Since you are going to replace this code anyway, it's academic
though.

What I said is a bit wrong actually: for the naked version of the
function you can go ahead and corrupt r12, because naked functions
are not inlinable and follow the ABI.  Adding "r12" in the clobber
list would be harmless in this case, but I don't think it's necessary.

asm() in any other context needs to declare all registers that it
might clobber.
