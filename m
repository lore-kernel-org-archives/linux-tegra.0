But above it also fails for I/O. Looking at this some more, it seems
like your patch isn't at fault. Rather there seems to be a general
resource assignment problem.

I'm having trouble understanding how that's supposed to work for regions
of prefetchable memory. At least on Tegra these can arbitrarily assigned
and I thought I had seen other platforms where this was also the case.

However the pcibios_min_mem (or the equivalent macro PCIBIOS_MIN_MEM) is
used while assigning the resources in the __pci_assign_resources() in
drivers/pci/setup-res.c, so it may influence things.

But I think the more fundamental issue here is that BARs are assigned
properly, only they are assigned too late in the DT case as opposed to
the board files case. I don't understand why that happens.
