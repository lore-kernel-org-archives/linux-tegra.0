I agree with John's view he posted before, he said:

"For context, these abstractions have grown out of the need for using
different hardware components for all of these. It was quite common
for x86 hardware to use the acpi_pm for clocksource, lapic/PIT for
clockevent, tsc for sched_clock and CMOS RTC for persistent clock.
While some of these could be backed by the same hardware, it wasn't
common. However, hardware with less restrictions have allowed in some
cases for these to be more unified, but I'm not sure if its particularly common.

Another part of the reason that we don't combine the above
abstractions, even when they are backed by the same hardware, is
because some of the fields used for freq conversion (mult/shift) have
different needs for the different types of accounting.

For instance, with a clocksource, we are very focused on avoiding
error to keep timekeeing accurate, thus we want to use as large a
shift (and thus mult) as possible (and do our shifting as late as
possible in our accounting). However, that then shrinks the amount of
time that can be accumulated in one go w/o causing an overflow.

Where as with sched_clock, we don't worry as much as about accuracy,
so we can use smaller shifts (and thus mults), and thus can go for
longer periods of time between accumulating without worrying.

Similarly for the persistent clock case we don't need need to worry as
much about accuracy, so we can can use smaller shifts, but we are not
in as much of a hot patch, so we can also"
