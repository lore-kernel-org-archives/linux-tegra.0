The problem was the case when the trigger that has been defined as
"default-trigger" in DT is not registered at the moment of LED class
driver probing. It is silently ignored by LED core.

It turned out that we accepted the commit too hastily, and in fact
that case seems not to be critical to the extent justifying preventing
LED class device registration.

Probably dev_warn() should be enough in this case. I've already dropped
the commit. Sorry for making confusion.
