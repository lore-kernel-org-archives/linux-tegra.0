You could see it as a performance optimization in some cases, e.g. when you
cannot flush individual IOTLBs or doing so is expensive, and you just keep
assigning new addresses until every one has been used, then you do a global
IOTLB flush once. Obviously you have to maintain the IO page tables correctly.
