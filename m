I had but it was going to be a much bigger and intrusive change. So I
went with this as a initial idea to see if others also had a need for
it. I am happy to start looking at extended the device struct if this is
the preferred path and I would agree that would make most sense.

Ok great.

Right. My initial thought would be that at least for device-tree based
configuration, that the order in which the pm-domains are defined in DT
would determine the order in which the pm-domains are power-on/off.

Ok. I will start having a think about this but will probably not get
back to this for a few weeks.
