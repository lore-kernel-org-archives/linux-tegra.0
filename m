But that's not how DT works; old DTs must continue to work.

Sure we need to move the code out of arch/arm so it can be shared with
arm64. However, that doesn't imply that we need to change anything about
the way the code works or is initialized; we can still do all the
initialization in response to a function call from the arch/board
support, and not in response to driver probe.
