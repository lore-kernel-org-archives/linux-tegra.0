Ok, I have rebased onto v4.18-rc1, killed the i2c-tegra hunk and converted
i2c_lock_root(foo) over to i2c_lock_bus(foo, I2C_LOCK_ROOT_ADAPTER) and
i2c_lock_segment(foo) over to i2c_lock_bus(foo, I2C_LOCK_SEGMENT). And I
of course killed a bunch of locking helpers in i2c.h.

I doing build tests now, will post a v2 in the morning.

Cheers,
Peter
