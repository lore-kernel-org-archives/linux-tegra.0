I had thought about that, but there are drivers that use
dma_request_slave_channel(), but fall back to dma_request_channel() if
that fails. I think there were other cases where the two APIs were
mixed. Drivers would then have a value that sometimes IS_ERR() or is
valid, and other times ==NULL or is valid. So, the values would have to
be checked using IS_ERR_OR_NULL() which I believe is now deprecated  -
certainly Russell will shout at me if I start introducing more usage! So
that means converting dma_request_channel()'s return value too, and that
is a /lot/ more to convert. I suppose an alternative might be to have
the individual affected drivers convert a NULL return from
dma_request_channel() to an ERR value, but for some reason I forget now,
even that looked problematic.
