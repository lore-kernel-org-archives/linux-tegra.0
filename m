The status should be updated once by HW and so there is no race condition.
HW behavior is that if the tx or Rx error occurs, it updates the status, 
generates interrupt and still continue transfer and later on, it 
generates the ready.
In first isr, we read status, error status found and so in isr thread, 
we reset controller to stop the transfer.

So in good state, only ready bit will be set and hence writing 1 to 
clear it.
In error state, clearing error first in ISR and in isr thread resetting 
the controller to stop the controller engine.

HW generates error,  then interrupt and still continue transfer and 
later point of time it generates the transfer done.
We want to stop the transfer once error get detected. For this we need 
to reset controller.
I did disabling rx and tx but still controller shows as busy.
