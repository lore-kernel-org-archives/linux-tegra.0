Not exactly at the 1st time, it may happen in the 3rd to 10th time. But
it only happens once. I mean I did check the
tick_broadcast_pending_mask, it only happens once the CPU didn't clear
the tick_broadcast_pending_mask after CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_EXIT.
And cause the warning message. Then I didn't see it happen anymore.
