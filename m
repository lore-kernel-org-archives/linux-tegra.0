I've looked at the details of the mailbox messages a bit more now. It
seems that the firmware running on the XUSB controller sends a variety
of different messages, some of which are relevant to the XHCI controller
driver and some relevant to the PHY/PAD driver. It's a pity these
different message streams are intermixed, but I guess that's not changing.

As such, I think at this stage it does make sense for the mailbox to be
represented as a separate node, with each of the XHCI controller and USB
PADCTL nodes referring to the mailbox node by phandle.

I'm still not 100% sure about whether the PHY driver is the same level
of abstraction intended by the Linux kernel's PHY layer. Pending that
discussion's results, the "PHY" message from the firmware may not go to
a Linux kernel PHY but some layer above which might get subsumed into
the overall XHCI controller driver, which would change my argument above
a bit.
