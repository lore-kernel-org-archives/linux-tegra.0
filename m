Why does the PMC care? An explanation of exactly what SW needs to know
about these groups and why would be a good idea.

Perhaps, although aren't these IDs specific to the connection between
modules and the SMMU? Or, are these IDs some more global concept; the HW
modules in question pass the same IDs to both the SMMU and to other HW
modules for some reason?

If the values are only needed to write the DT content, I'd tend to
prefer not defining them in a header in <dt-bindings/>; I consider that
directory a definition of the constants that define the ABI itself, not
as a random place to put useful things for DT. You can include headers
in the *.dts directory itself.
