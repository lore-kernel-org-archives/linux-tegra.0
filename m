Patch 3 and 4 to the MMC driver look fine. But I'd ask Chris to hold off
on applying them for 3.10 until I've sorted out the dependencies of
Joseph Lo's MMC patches; if I can get the device tree fix for the CD
GPIO polarity into 3.9/stable as a bug-fix, there will be no dependency
issue I think. Otherwise, I'll probably want to take all the Tegra SDHCI
changes through the Tegra tree for 3.10 to resolve the dependencies.
