I think you need to do something like this instead of using pci_scan_root_bus():

    pci_create_root_bus()
    pci_scan_child_bus()
    pci_bus_assign_resources()
    pci_bus_add_devices()

This is the effective order used by most of the pci_create_root_bus() callers.

Yes, it probably should.  I'm nervous about just throwing it in there
without quite a bit more analysis, but that's definitely the direction
I think we should be heading.
