Right, but I am concerned about someone calling tegra_powergate_set()
(which with patch 6 of this series) will poll for the state to change. I
am not sure we can guarantee the pointer does not change while this is
happening.

I agree it is cleaner, however, I am still concerned there could still
be a race.
