I've been looking at hooking up the Tegra GPIO controller's IRQ support
through device tree. It looks like I need to call irq_domain_add_simple()
for the GPIO node to make this work, and I think this needs to be triggered
by of_irq_init()'s match table, and hence I need a single of_irq_init()
call in Tegra's board-dt.c, which includes both the GIC and GPIO controller
entries.

Is my understanding here all correct? If so, I will just follow your
initial suggestion and have tegra_init_irq() do just:

if (!of_have_populated_dt())
        gic_init_bases(...);

... and move the of_irq_init call into board-dt.c.

Thanks.
