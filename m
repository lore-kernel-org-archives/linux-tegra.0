There's probably no need to move that entry just to change it?

I don't think these really warrant mentioning here; such properties are
part of the standard regulator and GPIO bindings, and are required as a
side-effect of a power sequence using a resource of those types, rather
than being something actively defined or needed directly by the
pwm-backlight binding.

For these two, I would personally simply say that the pwm-backlight
binding requires that two power sequences named "on" and "off" must
exists, and are to defined according to [1].
