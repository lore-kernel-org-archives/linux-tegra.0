Grr... this is due to the unfortunate UTMI pad controller design on Tegra.

Here's the issue:  When UTMI pad 0 is assigned to the EHCI controller
(as is currently the case on Jetson-TK1), the UTMI parameters from
UTMIP_BIAS_CFG0 in the global UTMI pad register space are used
regardless of the owner of the UTMI pads.  If pad 0 is assigned to the
XUSB controller, then parameters in USB2_BIAS_PAD_CTL0 in the XUSB
register space are used for all UTMI pads (again, regardless of
ownership).

I wasn't able to reproduce before because I always TFTP booted and
U-Boot programs the UTMI parameters correctly when starting the EHCI
controllers.  I suspect you and Tomeu were booting without starting
the EHCI controllers and thus were stuck with the POR values.

The easiest way to fix this is to just assign UTMI port 0 (i.e. the
OTG port) to the XUSB controller.  AFAIK, device mode on Tegra isn't
supported yet in the kernel, so this shouldn't break any existing use
cases.  If we wanted to support device mode in the future, it would
just have to be done with the XUSB controller instead.  The
alternative is some ugly driver that programs the correct register set
depending on which controller UTMI port 0 is assigned to.

BTW, here's a patch to assign UTMI port 0 to XUSB:
