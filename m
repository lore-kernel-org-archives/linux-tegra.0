This probably could be initialized from some DT property. However,
there's no such property defined right now, and considering that DT is
supposed to be an ABI, we'd always need the code in this patch as a
fallback for DTs that were created before any such property was defined.

Equally, since the data is SoC-specific rather than board-specific, and
is even fairly unlikely to vary between SoC versions since these values
are all 0xffffffff anyway, I don't really see much point in putting it
into DT, rather than just putting the static data into the driver.
