Right, but isn't this similar to what I was suggesting above in my
previous email?

I was proposing to have such a lower-layer by splitting the existing
genpd framework so the drivers would have the option of calling the
lower-level power control functions to look-up pm-domains and control
them directly from their rpm callbacks (if they need to). Same as we do
for clocks. This way you would not need to mess with the genpd ->start()
callback and leave it to the driver to handle itself as it knows what
needs to be done. This assumes that the device is never bound to the
pm-domain by the genpd core.

Cheers
Jon
