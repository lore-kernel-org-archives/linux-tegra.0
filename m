Will update patch description for next series.

I can rebase on the cpp usage, but for some stuff like the #define 
replacements, it sounded like things were still being hashed out (like 
.h location, include paths, etc) so I figured its safer not to base on 
those initially. If they are settled by the time i send this out again, 
i can use them as a base.
