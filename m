That's mostly right. My clk constraints series just allow consumers to
influence the effective rate of a clock, such as the EMC. And the
pm_qos series will allow to track the total memory bandwidth needs in
the system. I'm not sure yet where in the code this tracking will be
done. It could be done in an EMC driver in drivers/memory, but it's
probably too unrelated to be placed in the EMC clock driver.
