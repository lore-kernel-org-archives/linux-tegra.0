oops. Right. I was confusing this with the way i2c devices are
registered. I copied the way i2c was initialized in board-harmony.c

Grant and I have chatted about this. Our plan was to get to a
intermediate step where all of the devices inside the SoC including the
i2c controller (I believe the i2c controller itself is inside the SoC)
continue to be initialized using the current static method
(platform_device_register).

The implementation works like this ...

In tegra_dt_init(), of_platform_prepare() is called before devices are
registered. of_platform_prepare() makes note of all the device tree
nodes without registering anything.

When platform devices are registered (platform_device_register()),
of_platform is notified and it attaches the device tree node to the
device struct.

Then when all the SoC internal devices are done being registered using
the static method, there remains a set of device tree nodes that haven't
been registered as devices in the system. These device tree nodes should
be primarily for devices on the board and not in the SoC.

At this point, of_platform_populate() is called, this registers the
remaining devices in the device tree node so that drivers can be loaded
for them using device tree methods.

The reason for this approach was that this step would make for minimal
impact to existing systems. Yet it would still provide more flexibility
for board specific devices.

The thought was that once this is in place we can collectively
re-evaluate if we want to take the next step and initialize everything
from the device tree.
