I said "a" not "the".  Maybe I should've said "one last round of deferred
probing before entering userspace".

Yes - because the idea is that we do everything we do today without
printing anything about deferred probes.  We then set a flag which
indicates we should report defers, and then we trigger another round
of probes.

If everything probed successfully, the deferred probe list will be
empty and nothing will be seen.  Otherwise, we should end up with a
report of all the devices that weren't able to be bound to their
drivers due to -EPROBE_DEFER.

Yes, it means a little longer to boot, but if there's nothing pending
this _should_ only be microseconds - it should be nothing more than
setting the flag, possibly taking and releasing a lock, and checking
that the deferred probe list is empty.

Of course, if the deferred probe list isn't empty, then there'll be
more expense - but I'm willing to bet that for those developers with
serial console enabled, the kernel boot will be faster overall due
to the reduced number of characters printed during the boot.
