True. However, if we did have this "can-set-ppi-type" property set for a
device, it really should never fail (unless someone specified it
incorrectly). So I am trying to understand the value in adding a new DT
property.

Please note that gic_configure_irq() never used to return an error and
only when adding support for setting the type of PPIs was this added.
However, given that this has gone unnoticed and does not have a real
functional impact on the device behaviour, I wonder now if this function
should return an error? Yes, ideally, it should, but does it still make
sense?

Cheers
Jon
