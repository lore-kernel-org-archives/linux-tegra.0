The PCIe controller actually needs those supplies and won't work without
them. However on TrimSlice both of these supplies seem to be hardwired and
always on. At least that's what I deduce from the code because there is no
code that enables either the 1.05V or the pex-clk supplies.

My understanding of the fixed regulator was that it was meant to be used for
fixed voltage supplies that can still be enabled or disabled (for example as
supplied by a GPIO) but not regulators that are fix in the sense that they
cannot be enabled or disabled at all but are always on.

Then again, the fixed regulator binding says that the gpio property is
optional, so perhaps doing something like the following will work:

	pex_clk_reg: fixedregulator@0 {
		compatible =3D "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name =3D "PCIE CLK";
		regulator-min-microvolt =3D <3300000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt =3D <3300000>;
		regulator-always-on;
	};

	pcie_reg: fixedregulator@1 {
		compatible =3D "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name =3D "PCIE VDD";
		regulator-min-microvolt =3D <1050000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt =3D <1050000>;
		regulator-always-on;
	};

Is that how it is supposed to work?
