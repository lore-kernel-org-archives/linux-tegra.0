Per the TPS65911 discussion on regulator bindings, this node should have:

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

Each of these nodes should be named regulator@0, regulator@1, etc.

Within each of these nodes, you need a matching reg property.

	reg = <0>;

and something to identify which regulator within the chip this node
configurations, although I don't think we've reached a final decision on
the property name.

See the the following for details:
