Even though SDHCI controllers may have a dedicated WP pin that can be
queried using the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE register, some platforms may
chose to use a separate regular GPIO to route the WP signal. Such a
GPIO is typically represented using the wp-gpios property in the
Device Tree.

Unfortunately, the current sdhci_check_ro() function does not make use
of such GPIO when available: it either uses a host controller specific
->get_ro() operation, or uses the SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE. Several host
controller specific ->get_ro() functions are implemented just to check
a WP GPIO state.

Instead of pushing this to more controller-specific implementations,
let's handle this in the core SDHCI code, just like it is already done
for the CD GPIO in sdhci_get_cd().

The below patch simply changes sdhci_check_ro() to use the value of
the WP GPIO if available.

Changes since v2:

 - As suggested by Adrian Hunter, keep the argument of
   sdhci_check_ro() as it is: a "struct sdhci_host*"

Changes since v1:

 - As suggested by Adrian Hunter, call the ->get_ro() if it exists
   before falling back to using mmc_gpio_get_ro(). Indeed, if the
   controller-specific code has implemented a ->get_ro() callback, it
   should take precedence over what the SDHCI core does.

   Due to this change, I have not added Thierry Redding Reviewed-by.

 - Fix typo in the commit log noticed by Thierry Redding.
