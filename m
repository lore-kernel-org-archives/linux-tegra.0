OK, that's actually from my other patch to illustrate the problem:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20200103164710.4829-2-krzk@kernel.org/

After reverting of bc083a64b6c0, every driver that selects MFD_SYSCON
(or some other parts) has to depend on HAS_IOMEM.

Yes, HAS_DMA is the second missing piece for UM.
