... [a bunch of nodes for graphics-related HW modules]

That all looks reasonable.

I don't think you need both the child nodes and those two properties.

In other words, I think you either want:

	graphics@54000000 {
		... a bunch of child nodes
	};

or you want:

	disp1 : dc@54200000 {
		...
	};
	disp2 : dc@54240000 {
		...
	};
	... all the other graphics nodes

	graphics@54000000 {
		display-controllers = <&disp1 &disp2>;
		outputs = <&lvds &hdmi &tvo &dsi>;
	};

In the former case, presumably the drivers for the child nodes would
make some API call into the parent node and just register themselves
directly as a certain type of driver, so avoiding the
display-controllers/outputs properties.

Isn't that kind of thing usually set up by the video= KMS-related kernel
command-line option? See Documentation/fb/modedb.txt. Again here, I
think the actual display controllers would be allocated to whichever
outputs get used on a first-come first-serve based, so no need for the
display-controller property above either way.

I think there's a third node type.

1) Nodes for the display controllers in Tegra (Also known as CRTCs I
believe)

2) Nodes for the video outputs from the Tegra chips (what you have as
outputs above)

3) Connectors, which aren't represented in your DT above yet.

I think you need to add additional nodes for (3). These are where you'd
represent all the EDID/I2C/... stuff. Then, the nodes for the outputs
will point at the nodes for the connectors using phandles, or vice-versa.

(IIRC, although I didn't look at them in detail, the sdrm patches
recently mentioned something about splitting up the various object types
in DRM and allowing them to be represented separately, and I vaguely
recall something along the lines of the types I mention above. I might
expect to have a 1:1 mapping between the DRM object types and DT nodes.)
