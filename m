Will do. Information about TF is scarce unfortunately.

They can probably, but in theory nothing prevents a board from coming
with different secure monitors (or none at all). In this case, just
having the board name might not be enough.

Having a proper node for the firmware like David and Tomasz suggested
seems to be the best way to make sure we cover all cases - I think I
will try to do it this way for the next version, and hopefully come
with a binding that is useful for everyone.

Thanks,
