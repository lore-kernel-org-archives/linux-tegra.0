I think it does, and up until a few minutes ago I was even sure that I
had tested it once. But looking at the various boards that I have I
don't think I actually have test equipment that's wired the proper way
to test this.

Perhaps for now it would be better to make the binding stricter. The
wording could be relaxed if we ever determine that it still works
correctly with a number of PHYs smaller than the number of lanes.
