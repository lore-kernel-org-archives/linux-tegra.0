True, that would look nicer.

Maybe we could resort to checking the controller address in this case. 
This is a safety feature, so programming the wrong controller index 
accidentally would be bad.

No, it takes a pinmux ID, described in the boot process (non-public in 
T124 I guess..) section of the TRM. It seems, though, that all platforms 
supported by the downstream kernel have pinmux == 0.

That's how it's described in the TRM, but I just found a comment in the 
downstream kernel about it. Apparently it controls the amount of data 
sent to the PMIC. The downstream kernel says, though, that the option is 
not supported and must always be left as zero, so I guess it could be 
dropped.
