There are several drivers which use sdhci_pltfm_clk_get_max_clock() in
its current state and changing it could have unforeseen side-effects on
drivers which I'm unable to test. Adding another variant of 
sdhci_pltfm_clk_get_max_clock() would probably be a more feasible
approach.

As far as I can tell the original tegra_sdhci_get_max_clock() was
implemented this way in order to force sdhci_calc_clk() to always set
the SDHCI clock divider to two on sdhci_set_clock(). The requirement to
configure the SDHCI divider to two is specific to DDR50/52 modes on
Tegra.

The .get_max_clock() callback retuning half of the actual maximum will
result in HS200 and HS400 modes not being able to run at full speed.
Another mechanism to enforce the divider requirement has to be figured
out in order to enable DDR50/52 modes on Tegra SoCs.
