Ah, yes.

[Grant, Thomas, as GPIO/IRQ maintainers, do you agree that (a) below is
something the core IRQ code should be doing?]

There are two aspects to this:

a) The generic gpio_request/gpio_direction_input. This could be handled
by the core irq code if struct irq_chip grew a to_irq function, and a
__irq_to_gpio/irq_to_gpio global function were created to mirror
gpio_to_irq.

b) On Tegra at least, we need to call tegra_gpio_enable to configure the
pin to be a GPIO. This isn't performed by the Tegra GPIO driver during
gpio_request, since such configuration is supposed to be outside the
domain of the GPIO driver, but deferred to perhaps a pinmux driver. Should
the same be true of request_irq; should it require the user to somehow
call tegra_gpio_enable elsewhere? It'd be asymmetric to how gpio_request
worked, but Tegra's irq_chip could easily call tegra_gpio_enable from
within irq_chip.startup, thus simplifying any code that wants to use
interrupt-that-are-GPIOs.

The alternative is for the board files to have a list of GPIOs for which
to call tegra_gpio_enable, and indeed, that's what we do have in Tegra
e.g. in board-seaboard-pinmux.c.

I suppose with the new pinmux API, there will simply be a pinmux table in
either the board file or Device Tree, and that will allow "GPIO" as a legal
"special function" for each pin, and for pins which are really "GPIO
interrupts", we'll just need to list "GPIO" in that pinmux table, so perhaps
everything will just fall out cleanly that way. I suppose that a pinmux
driver could even expose an "interrupt" special function for relevant pins
just to clearly document the usage, even if this maps to the same thing as
configuring a pin as a GPIO.

Sure, it doesn't look too hard.

A complication is that ARM doesn't define gpio_to_irq in a single central
header, but rather one per subarchitecture, I suppose since not all 
subarchitectures implement/require gpiolib. Still, I think this mostly
just means cut/pasting "#define irq_to_gpio __irq_to_gpio" into each
mach-foo's gpio.h for now, so /probably/ not a big deal...

Maybe the solution for Tegra, once we have the new pinmux API in place,
is for the pinmux driver initialization to program all pins in HW as
input GPIOs, and hence tri-stated. That way, there can never be any
conflict with external HW. If/once a pin/group is requested as a
particular special function, the tri-state can be removed, since then
we'll know the board-specific direction. Some though may have to be
given to not tri-stating any pins required for basic SDRAM or UART
access during the boot process, but this is probably workable.
