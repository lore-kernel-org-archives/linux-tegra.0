I agree that this code is a lot better than the previous
'irqs_disabled() || in_atomic()'. It also makes clear that the atomic
I2C transfers is only meant for late shutdown I2C communcation.


After I read the article https://lwn.net/Articles/274695/ again I
nevertheless cannot really say whether the usage of 'irqs_disabled()' is
the theoretical correct approach. The article states explicitly that
only the caller can really decided whether the operation should be
atomic or not.

Recap from previous discussions:

But then you have to patch every call site to use either a new function
like 'i2c_transfer_atomic()' or the extend I2C message flags. And mostly
also supported this trough regmap and maybe other translation layers,
which seems unpractical, may breaking existing usages and maybe not
worth the hassle.

For me this patch seems good and I don't know better.

Kind regards,
Stefan
