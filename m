The value comes from the return value of i2c_smbus_read_byte_data. If
the value is below zero its an EIO error. 

I could add a variable "version", but for me it felt strange because we
check if version is below zero. This feels like its a wrong version
rather than a transmit error. So I would prefer ret over version. But I
agree, when one just reads the patch, its not obvious what exactly
happens.

In v2, I moved the i2c_smbus_read_byte_data function call after the
allocation, so it was more obvious for the reader. But then, as Thierry
Reding pointed out, not moving it is an optimization: In case reading
fails, we don't allocate memory first.
