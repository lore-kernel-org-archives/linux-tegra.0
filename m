I meant drivers/cpuidle.

So this is the suspend code which should go along with rest of your
PM code.

It does have AVS PM code as well and also home for power controller
code. Similar efforts are happening on OMAP [1] to move the PM code
under drivers/power/*

Please see above.

You answered yourself. I don't see any point moving such a code to drivers
which is really SMP bring up code for ARM 32 bit. For ARM 64 bit, as
outline by maintainers (Catalin, Arnd), you should use PSCI or DT based
boot scheme.

Infact all of your code already has a potential home and I
suggest you discuss it with those subsystem maintainers.
