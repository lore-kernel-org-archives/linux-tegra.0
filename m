For kexec, I think it's perfectly reasonable to mandate hardware-based
offlining for the secondary cores (hence the half-hearted dependency on
HOTPLUG_CPU). In that case, the only guy that has to go down the soft
reboot path is the primary CPU which shouldn't be too problematic, right?

Supporting sort-reboot of secondaries is a total PITA, even if you have some
`safe place' to put them. You still have to synchronise with non-coherent
cores so that you know when it's safe to clobber the old image, which
requires complex locking algorithms and a prevailing wind.
