Hello,

Recently Peter Geis (who is working on Tegra30 cpufreq driver) asked me how
tegra20-cpufreq driver is getting loaded. After taking a look at the code
it became apparent that the drivers code has been rusted a tad and so this
series is intended to refresh the drivers code by disallowing module to be
loaded on non-Tegra20 machines, by cleaning whitespaces in the code, removing
dead EMC code and in the end by allowing tegra20-cpufreq to be built as a
loadable module.

Changelog:

v2:
	- Added the new patch to the series: "Remove unnecessary parentheses",
	  please review.

	- Addressed review comments to the v1 of the series:

	1) Kept undeleted necessary headers in the "Clean up included headers"
	   patch as per Viresh's Kumar request.

	2) Renamed tegra20_cpufreq_data to tegra20_cpufreq and moved cpufreq
	   driver structure to the tegra20_cpufreq as per Thierry's Reding
	   request.

	- Dropped "ARM: tegra: Create platform device for tegra20-cpufreq driver"
	  patch from the series as Thierry already applied it and submitted
	  in the "ARM: tegra: Core changes for v4.18-rc1" pull request.
