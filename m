icc_set() is very generic, but this function isn't easily extended to
other parameters than bandwidth. Perhaps icc_set_bandwidth() instead.
Then when you add some other setting, you just add a new function. Of
course, if you wind up with a bunch of different parameters, then
you'll probably need an atomic type interface where you test all the
settings together and then commit them separately in one call. But
from a DT perspective, I certainly hope there are not lots of new
settings folks want to add. :)
