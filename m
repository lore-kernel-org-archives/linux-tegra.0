I think (after a quick look at devfreq's source) that you can avoid 
polling altogether if you set polling_ms to 0 in your 
devfreq_dev_profile instance. Then it is up to you to call 
update_devfreq() from your custom governor whenever it sees fit.

ACTMON support seems to overlap between being a governor (which reacts 
to ACTMON interrupts and calls update_devfreq() when needed) and part of 
a devfreq_dev_profile (get_dev_status() needs to use the actmon 
counters). If we keep your current design where the driver simply 
controls a clock, you could have the ACTMON driver obtain that clock, 
register its governor, create a non-polling devfreq_dev_profile that 
controls that clock, and just call devfreq_add_device() with both. Then 
we will have the benefit of being able to use ACTMON as well as the 
performance and powersave governors on EMC, and switch policies dynamically.

Another benefit is that you will have a placeholder in the governor to 
implement suspend/resume for the ACTMON IP, in case this becomes 
necessary in the future.

Do you think that would work? Apart from the polling which doesn't seem 
to be an issue, have you seen any other redundancy between devfreq and 
ACTMON?

Yes, and that's fine. Actually if the parameters of the ACTMON governor 
could be fine-tuned via sysfs, that would just be perfect.

AFAICT we can keep that edge while getting the benefit of using a common 
framework. Also I expect quite some resistance against the merge of this 
driver if it is not using devfreq. You probably can tell us better 
whether it is fit or not, but can you examine my points above and let us 
know what you think? After a quick look, it actually looks quite 
exploitable for our use-case.

Cheers,
Alex.
