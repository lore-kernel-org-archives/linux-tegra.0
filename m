Sorry if I wasn't clear -- my plan with the current framework IS to make 
nested (as in, inside the set rate op) calls to __clk_prepare() and 
enable() as needed. But my point is that everyone really wants to do the 
same, so we might as well make it better by putting it in the common 
code and having everyone use it instead of having to redo the same code 
all over the place.

Will send out the patch soon.
