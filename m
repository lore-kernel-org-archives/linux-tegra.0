Describing this in DT is a separate, but related question. However can
we first focus on how to manage this in software. :-)

Exactly.

I think this is what Rafael wanted us avoid (because of the complexity
involved). Instead the suggestion is to deal with this on top of the
existing PM domain structure, as "power resources" instead. Unless I
missed his point. :-)

Then *my* point is: To be able to implement that, still only allowing
one PM domain per device, we would anyway need a new layer in-between
the PM domain (genpd) and the driver controlling the device. Simply
because these two entities, needs to be able to exchange information
about which "power resources" that shall be turned off/on, when the
driver do pm_runtime_get|put().

That approach should be compared with adding/extending the PM domain
framework, something along the lines what you started with in $subject
series.

Kind regards
Uffe
