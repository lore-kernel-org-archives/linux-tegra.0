We discussed the same issue when the X-gene PCI host driver was first
reviewed, and someone from APM then clarified that it had the same bug.

However, I don't know the details about the Tegra implementation, or
whether the X-Gene bug has been fixed in a newer version of the parts,
so we need to get confirmation from the respective developers before
applying any of the patches. If X-gene has been fixed in the meantime,
we need to make sure we match on the exact product numbers in the
compatible property so we only do it for the newer ones.
