Unfortunately this is not "the last point for probe to succeed or defer".
There are still a bunch of drivers in Kernel which will be probed at late_initcall() level.
(like ./drivers/net/ethernet/ti/cpsw.c => late_initcall(cpsw_init);
Yes - they probably need to be updated to use module_init(), but that's what
we have now). Those drivers will re-trigger deferred device probing if their
probe succeeded.

As result, it is impossible to say when will it happen the 
"final round of deferred device probing" :( and final list of drivers which
was "deferred forever" will be know only when kernel exits to User space 
("deferred forever" - before loading modules).

May be, we also can consider adding debug_fs entry which can be used to display
actual state of deferred_probe_pending_list?
