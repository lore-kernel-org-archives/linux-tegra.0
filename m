sounds good.

It could. In regulator_dev_lookup we have:

		if (node) {
			...
		} else {
			/*
			 * If we couldn't even get the node then it's
			 * not just that the device didn't register
			 * yet, there's no node and we'll never
			 * succeed.
			 */
			*ret = -ENODEV;
		}

So here the regulator core knows that there is no regulator and never
will be. All that needs to be done is to make _regulator_get look at
that value.
There may be some side effects if we just return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) when
regulator_dev_lookup returns -ENODEV. Maybe Mark has some comments to
this.
