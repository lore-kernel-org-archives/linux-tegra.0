Sure, if we can always be consistent, that might be best.

Where I was coming from here is that, if we're not supposed to use
soc_device_to_device(), then we have no way to associate an of_node with
the soc_device from the outside (and nobody was doing it today, as per
my analysis). We'd either need a new helper of_soc_device_register()
with additional argument for the node, or it would need to be done
entirely in the infrastructure as I suggested, be it by looking for one
hardcoded /soc node or for nodes with device_type = "soc".

Rob, in light of this discussion, should we start adding the latter
property for new DTs such as my new Realtek SoCs, or was there a reason
this has not been used consistently outside of powerpc and nios2?
Intel/Altera appear to be the only two in arm64, with only three more in
arm, none in mips.

(BTW my assumption was that we don't follow the booting-without-of.txt
documented schema of soc<SOCname> so that we can share .dtsi across
differently named SoCs, is that correct?)

The majority was indeed passing in NULL, so yeah, we might clean that
up, if someone could come up with a plan of where/how to implement it.

Cheers,
