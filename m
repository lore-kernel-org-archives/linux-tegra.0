At this point, I'm thinking that the added complexity of a per-pm-domain
struct device isn't justified.  Managing simple lists of clocks in the
SoC specific PM domains is quite easy to review and maintain, IMO.

So I recommend just keeping it that way for now.  If it starts to get
unwieldy for tegra, rockchip and any others, we can revisit a common way
of doing it then.
