No need for the brackets there.

BTW, could you Cc Colin Cross on any future revisions of these patches;
it'd be good to get his take on them.

It would be slightly clearer if that was written:

* r2 = flag[0] (in SCRATCH38)
* r3 = flag[1] (in SCRATCH39)

since the meaning of r2/r3 is what's being selected.

Should that be "str r0, [r1]"? Otherwise, you're always writing 1 there,
not writing the CPU ID as expected.
