Sry, for delayed reply - I've saw this series, but, honestly, it's very big 
change for review :(

So, can it be split? I think, patches which reorganize gpio irqchip specific fields placement 
and move them in gpio_irq_chip can be considered separately if they will not introduce
functional changes. Also, omap changes can be considered separately.
(Pay attention that new fields introduced in patch 1).  

Regarding OMAP GPIO - right now I do not see how it can be applied for OMAP :(
Each OMAP GPIO bank is standalone device which can be enabled/disabled, 
powered on/off in Linux. There are no contiguous MMIO space and each GPIO
bank have separate MMIO space.

I really, need more time to review this idea and I think that it can be done
more easily if series size will be reduced.

Few more notes:
- pay attention on commit dc749a0 "gpiolib: allow gpio irqchip to map irqs dynamically"
- good to see binding and DT examples
- not sure if I've got idea of encoding bank&pin in spec[0] :(

+	bank = (spec[0] >> gc->of_gpio_bank_mask) & gc->of_gpio_bank_shift;
+	pin = (spec[0] >> gc->of_gpio_pin_mask) & gc->of_gpio_pin_shift;

- irq "mapping" inside gpio_irq_chip is not clear :( does it static?
does it require one array item/per pin - sry, this is waste of memory?

irq->map[offset + j] = irq->parents[parent];

Potentially, this feature can be applied to Davinci GPIO driver, which
is GPIO controller divided in multiple logical banks and which also have
set of common registers for all logical banks. But, again, not sure how
effective this implementation is - need more time. As of now, we perfectly 
handle this in Davinci GPIO driver by creating only ONE gpio_chip which hides
HW details in driver and still uses standard irq DT mappings:
 <&gpio0 140 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

By the way Patch 14 adds 300 lines, while patch changes 200 lines, so
in terms of code lines this feature seems is not very efficient.
(same for Patch 15, 16)
