and this contradicts each other!
If there is a call to message pump, then we should process a message
and the counters should increase.

If those counters do not increase then there is something strange.

If we are called without anything to do then the pump should trigger a
tear down and stop.

I am wondering where busy/running would be set in the first place
if there are no counters...

Is it possible that the specific flash is not using the “normal” 
spi_pump_message, but spi_controller_mem_ops operations? 

Maybe we are missing the teardown in that driver or something is
changing flags there.

grepping a bit:

I see spi_mem_access_start calling spi_flush_queue, which is calling
pump_message, which - if there is no transfer - will trigger a delayed
tear-down, while it maybe should not be doing that.

Maybe spi_mem_access_end needs a call to spi_flush_queue as well?

Unfortunately this is theoretical work and quite a lot of guesswork
without an actual device available for testing...

Thanks,
