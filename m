One drawback of having --- in the commit message is that you can't
cherry-pick but really need to use git-am for it to be stripped.

I resorted to a scripted way of handling change logs: Per patch series =
I
maintain a shell script that after git-format-patch essentially runs
sed -i "/---/ r /dev/stdin" $OUTDIR/0001-*.patch <<EOCL
=2E..
EOCL
to insert my text after ---. (sed syntax is not POSIX-compliant FWIW.)
Similarly I fill in the blurbs for the cover letter.

Another way I've heard of is git-notes, which lets you associate text
with a given commit id.
But in my tests that data did not survive a git-rebase -i, it stayed
attached to the original commit when editing the commit message or
fixing up a patch. It could still be accessed through the list of
git-notes but not be comfortably extracted from the updated branch via
git-rev-list or the likes.

Cheers,
Andreas
