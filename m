We're talking about memory-mapped on-SoC devices here, that generally
only exist inside Tegra SoCs.

Even ignoring that (i.e. expanding the argument to arbitrary modules),
having drivers that perform bus-master transactions call a function
of_iommu_attach() or similar, which does nothing if the device isn't
behind an IOMMU but otherwise does whatever is required, seems like it
isn't much of an imposition.

If this turns out to be something that lots of devices benefit from, we
could do the same thing that pinctrl does for "hogs", and make the
function call in the driver core. But note that's still part of the
probing flow (just implemented in the driver core) rather than bus
notifier based, hence keeps the same simplicity.
