Looking at both boards that fail, tegra30-cardhu-a04 and
tegra124-jetson-tk1 they both have a spi-flash. The compatible strings
for the spi flashes are "winbond,w25q32" and "winbond,w25q32dw",
respectively which interestingly are not documented/used anywhere in the
kernel. It appears that there was a patch to fix this a few years back
but never got applied [0]. However, applying this patch does not fix the
issue. Furthermore, without this patch applied I see that the spi flash
is detected fine ...

[    2.540395] m25p80 spi1.0: w25q32dw (4096 Kbytes)

So this is not related but the main point is occurs with a spi flash device=
.

No and before suspending I dumped some of the spi stats and I see no
tranfers/messages at all ...

Stats for spi1 ...

Unfortunately, the above did not help and the issue persists.

Digging a bit deeper I see that now the 'ctlr->queue' is empty but
'ctlr->busy' flag is set and this is causing the 'could not stop message
queue' error.

It seems that __spi_pump_messages() is getting called several times
during boot when registering the spi-flash, then after the spi-flash has
been registered, about a 1 sec later spi_pump_idle_teardown() is called
(as expected), but exits because 'ctlr->running' is true. However,
spi_pump_idle_teardown() is never called again and when we suspend we
are stuck in the busy/running state. In this case should something be
scheduling spi_pump_idle_teardown() again? Although even if it does I
don't see where the busy flag would be cleared in this path?

Cheers
Jon
