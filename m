Ideally the drivers depending on the IOMMU would return -EPROBE_DEFER if
the IOMMU driver isn't set up so that you don't need to play games with
probe order. Creating certain platform devices early is a really ugly
and fragile solution.

Besides, probe order of device drivers is far more about link order of
the kernel than it is about when of_platform_device_create() is called.
Fiddling with the initcall level on the IOMMU driver (while not
recommended) may very well have the effect you desire.
