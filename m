I believe so, yes. In particular we have the following register bits:

1) Register bit AHB_ARBITRATION_XBAR_CTRL_SMMU_INIT_DONE is an overall
SMMU enable flag. This sits outside the SMMU module itself, but the SMMU
probe function requests drivers/amba/tegra-ahb.c:tegra_ahb_enable_smmu()
to go enable it.

2) Each memory client ID has a bit in SMMU_TRANSLATION_ENABLE_* to
enable translation for the client. This is also enabled during the SMMU
probe function.

3) Each swgroup ID has a register indicating which ASID to use for
translation, and an associated enable bit. These are also set up during
SMMU probe at present.

I believe when any of those bits aren't enabled, the SMMU is a
pass-through, considering that I'm pretty sure if I disable the SMMU
driver in the kernel, everything will still work just fine.
