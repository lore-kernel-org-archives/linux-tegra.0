I noticed a couple more issues.

First, the clock rate rounding behaviour changes with your patch series
for at least the I2C clocks.

With I2C, you specify how fast you want the bus to go. The bus shouldn't
run any faster than that since the rate matches the max specification
for the attached devices. So the clock framework should pick the
smallest divider that yields a clock that doesn't exceed the request
from clk_set_rate(). However, the new code seems to pick the smallest
divider that yields at least the requested clock. I can certainly see
that other clocks (say memory, CPU, or other internal
performance-related clocks) might want to round the other way though.

The I2C driver sets its module clock to 8 times the desired bus rate.
This yields a request of:

desired bus rate: 100 KHz
desired clock rate: 800 KHz
actual clock rate before your change: 800 KHz
actual clock rate after your change: 800 KHz
-> OK

desired bus rate: 400 KHz
desired clock rate: 3.2 MHz
actual clock rate before your change: 3 MHz (so 375 KHz bus rate, OK)
actual clock rate after your change: 4 MHZ (so 500 KHz bus rate, BAD)

desired bus rate: 80 KHz (Toshiba AC100's nvec/I2C slave driver)
desired clock rate: 640 KHz
actual clock rate before your change: ~632 KHz (so ~79 KHz bus rate, OK)
actual clock rate after your change: ~706 KHz (so ~88 KHz bus rate, BAD)

Can this be fixed?

Second, the Toshiba AC100 uses an alternative driver for the I2C HW,
since it operates in I2C slave mode. So, the DT node for that driver
needs to include the clocks properties so the driver can get the clocks
through DT:

Your changes don't actually cause the driver to break though, since it
abuses clk_get_sys() to retrieve clocks under a different driver name,
which matches what the clock driver provides. However, I think you
should also include the following patch at the end of your series to fix
this up, so the clock looking happens through device tree:

Thanks.
