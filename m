I understand that TTM looks like a big complex beast at first sight, bu=
t
trying to understand how it works avoids reinventing the wheel over and
over again. We still have to solve problems like cache invalidation,
synchronization and swap-out of dma buffers, which is a lot easier if w=
e
go with a common framework.=20

That's exactly the level we are providing to userspace from other
drivers using TTM like radeon or nouveau.

dma_buf at the current level is only a way to share buffers and does no=
t
provide enough information about the buffer to be useful as an
abstraction level on top of multiple memory managers. But I agree that
we should try to get dma_buf integration right from the start, as the
zero-copy share a very useful thing to have.
