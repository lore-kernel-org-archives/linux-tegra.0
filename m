As I explained elsewhere, I actually went and implemented this. But
given the nature of buffering, this ends up making the TCU completely
useless as a console because in case of a crash, the system will stop
working with a large number of characters still stuck in the buffer.
And that's especially bad in case of a crash because those last
characters that get stuck in the buffer are the most relevant ones
because they contain the stack dump.

First of all, this is not about development-phase early-boot messages.
We're talking about the system console here. This is what everyone will
want to be using when developing on this device. Sure at some point you
may end up with a system that works and you can have the console on the
network or an attached display or whatever, but even then you may still
want to attach to the console if you ever run into issues where the
system doesn't come up.

Secondly, I don't understand why you think this is an emulated console.
The way that this works is that there's a microprocessor in the system
that interacts with other microprocessors via shared mailboxes to
receive log messages. That microprocessor collects these log messages
and outputs them on a physical UART via multiplexed streams. The host
system can connect to that physical UART and demultiplex these streams
to get the individual log messages from each of the components in the
system.

Lastly, I don't understand why you think we're messing up the API here.
The proposal in this series doesn't even change any of the API, but it
makes it aware of the state of interrupts internally so that it can do
the right thing depending on the call stack. The other proposal, in v3,
is more explicit in that it adds new API to flush the mailbox. The new
API is completely optional and I even offered to document it as being
discouraged because it involves busy looping. At the same time it does
solve a real problem and it doesn't impact any existing mailbox drivers
nor any of their users (because it is completely opt-in).

While I can somewhat relate to your reluctance to extend the API, I do
not see a way around it. Sure, you could decide that this is something
that Linux just won't support, but that would be a first. I'm not aware
of any cases where a concious decision was ever made not to support a
feature because it didn't fit into any existing frameworks. Typically
we deal with this by improving things so that we can support the
additional use-cases. It's really one of the strong points of Linux.

I'm open to any suggestions on how this could be done better. You had
already suggested the ring buffer and I did go and implement it, but it
only confirmed the concerns that I've had with it all along. I realize
that at this point I may be blind to other obvious solutions, but I've
done my best to come up with alternatives and none of them work. If you
have any other ideas, please do share them and I will investigate.

Just as an additional note: it's not the driver that actually requires
the busy looping, it's the use-case (i.e. the consumer). The driver is
working perfectly fine with interrupts enabled, it's just that in the
particular use-case of the console that we have no way of detecting if
or when an interrupt occurred.

Greg,

any ideas on how we can move forward here? For reasons given elsewhere
in this thread I understand that there is no way to make the console
code run in non-atomic context. Have you ever run into a case where the
console driver couldn't busy-loop? Were there any solutions to this?

I've looked through quite a few drivers and they all end up with a busy
loop, waiting for the transmission FIFO to become empty. There are also
a few implementations for hypervisors that call back into some firmware
in order to send the characters, but I expect those to do the busy
looping in the firmware.

Perhaps the most prominent case that I came across and that is quite
similar to this discussion is netconsole. There's a lot of code in the
network layer that exists only to allow using a network device for
outputting a console. I don't think the changes to the mailbox
framework are anywhere near as complicated.

Thierry
