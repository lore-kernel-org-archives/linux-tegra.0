That's mostly happened through my recent set of 100 or so patches.
There's a few areas where that's not quite as easy as it should be,
but on the whole, it's mostly complete.

The other thing I forgot to mention, and I suspect it's particular to
SA11x0, is that the GPDR must be set correctly according to the special
function as well as GAFR.  So, if a special function involves driving
a pin, the pin must be set as an output in GPDR.  Conversely, if the
special function involves input only, the pin must be set as an input
in GPDR.

So, on SA11x0, gpio and pin configuration are intimately linked.
