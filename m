Exactly.

As is, coupled cpuidle will work on Tegra30, but it will unnecessarily
wake up the secondary cpus during the transitions to off and back on
again.  Those cpus will immediately go back to single-cpu LP2, so it
may not be a big deal, but there is a small optimization I've
discussed with a few other people that could avoid waking them up.  I
suggest adding an extra pre-idle hook to the Tegra30 that is called by
coupled cpuidle on the last cpu to go down.  It would return a cpumask
of cpus that have been prepared for idle by guaranteeing that they
will not wake up from an interrupt, and therefore don't need to be
woken up for the transitions.  I haven't worked with a cpu that needs
this optimization yet, so I haven't done it.
