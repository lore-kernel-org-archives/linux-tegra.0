The other alternative would involve using a single property to encode
one sequence. I think that was the initial proposal, though using proper
phandle encoding it could probably be enhanced a bit. However anything
that involves a single property has the problem that we need to encode
the type of resource as an integer, and that makes things very hard to
read.

So it would look something like this:

	power-on =3D <1  &gpio 6 0            1
		    0                   10000
		    2  &reg                 1
		    3  &pwm  0 5000000      1>;

	power-off =3D <3  &pwm  0 5000000      0
		     2  &reg                 0
		     0                   10000
		     1  &gpio 6 0            0>;

So the first cell would encode the type:
  0: delay
  1: gpio
  2: regulator
  3: PWM

The next n cells would be the phandle and the specifier, while the last
cell would encode a resource-specific parameter:
  delay: time in microseconds
  gpio: set level (0: low, 1: high)
  regulator: 0: disable, 1: enable
  pwm: 0: disable, 1: enable

I guess this would be more compact, but it is also very hard to read. Is
that something you would be happier with? Perhaps you were thinking of
something completely different?
