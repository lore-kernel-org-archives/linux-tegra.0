Stefan,

It'd be best to include the commit subject rather than just the commit
hash, i.e.:

... and reverts commit eca8f98e4049 "ARM: tegra: dalmore: fix the irq
trigger type of Palmas MFD device".

It may also be helpful for the commit description to quote the kernel
boot message which this patch solves:

> [    0.215178] genirq: Setting trigger mode 8 for irq 118 failed (gic_set_type+0x0/0xf4)

For me, applying this patch actually *causes* an interrupt storm, rather
than preventing one. Yet without it, no interrupts occur at all. I
wonder if the driver has a bug where it's not correctly clearing all
interrupt status (e.g. something pre-existing before boot), so once the
polarity is set up correctly, the interrupt is stuck?

Joseph,

As the author of the patch that's being reverted, can you please comment
here?
