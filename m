That sounds fine to me.  I got totally confused trying to figure out the 
difference between CONFIG_LOADADDR and CONFIG_SYS_LOAD_ADDR.

I always used to treat CONFIG_LOADADDR as the "recommended" load address 
for the kernel, as did my colleagues.  But that was years ago in the 
days of uImages and things have changed a lot since then.  So to be 
perfectly honest, I don't know what the right path forward is.  I'd hate 
to add more work to your plate, but maybe we should ask on the U-boot 
mailing lists to see what folks there would recommend?  If you're busy 
I'd be happy to send the initial query, just let me know.

Otherwise, I think you probably know U-boot better than I, so ultimately 
I'm fine with your discretion.
