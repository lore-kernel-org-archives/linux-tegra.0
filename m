Hello.

   This patchset is against the usb-next' branch of Greg KH's 'usb.git' repo.
Here I add support for the generic PHY to the 'struct usb_hcd' (having to
rename the existing 'phy' field to 'usb_phy' beforehand). This was mainly
intended to be used with the PCI OHCI/EHCI drivers and also xHCI driver;
however there are several more dependent patchsets now posted to 'linux-usb'.
   Greg, if you want links to these patchsets and the device tree patches using
this patchset in order to link the PCI OHCI/EHCI devices to the PHY, just ask
(I have already posted the previously but will probably have to repost them
again)...

[1/2] usb: rename phy to usb_phy in HCD
[2/2] usb: hcd: add generic PHY support

WBR, Sergei
