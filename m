This series adds support for xHCI on NVIDIA Tegra SoCs.  This includes:
 - patches 1, 2, and 3: minor cleanups for mailbox framework and xHCI,
 - patches 4 and 5: adding an MFD driver for the XUSB cmoplex,
 - patches 6 and 7: adding a driver for the mailbox used to communicate
   with the xHCI controller's firmware, and
 - patches 8 and 9: adding a xHCI host-controller driver.

The addition of USB PHY support to the XUSB padctl driver has been dropped.
Thierry will be posting those patches later.

Given the many compile and run-time dependencies in this series, it is probably
best if the first 3 patches are picked up by the relevant maintainers in topic
branches so that the remainder of the series can go through the Tegra tree.

Tested on Jetson TK1 and Nyan-Big with a variety of USB2.0 and USB3.0 memory
sticks and ethernet dongles.  This has also been tested, with additional
out-of-tree patches, on Tegra132 and Tegra210 based boards.

Based on v4.1-rc2.  A branch with the entire series is available at:
  https://github.com/abrestic/linux/tree/tegra-xhci-v8

Changes from v7:
 - Move non-shared resources into child nodes of MFD.
 - Fixed a couple of mailbox driver bugs.

Changes from v6:
 - Dropped PHY changes from series.  Will be posted later by Thierry.
 - Added an MFD device with the mailbox and xHCI host as sub-devices.

Changes from v5:
 - Addressed review comments from Jassi and Felipe.

Changes from v4:
 - Made USB support optional in padctl driver.
 - Made usb3-port a pinconfig property again.
 - Cleaned up mbox_request_channel() error handling and allowed it to defer
   probing (patch 3).
 - Minor xHCI (patch 1) and mailbox framework (patch 2) cleanups suggested
   by Thierry.
 - Addressed Thierry's review comments.

Changes from v3:
 - Fixed USB2.0 flakiness on Jetson-TK1.
 - Switched to 32-bit DMA mask for host.
 - Addressed Stephen's review comments.

Chagnes from v2:
 - Dropped mailbox channel specifier.  The mailbox driver allocates virtual
   channels backed by the single physical channel.
 - Added support for HS_CURR_LEVEL adjustment pinconfig property, which
   will be required for the Blaze board.
 - Addressed Stephen's review comments.

Changes from v1:
 - Converted mailbox driver to use the common mailbox framework.
 - Fixed up host driver so that it can now be built and used as a module.
 - Addressed Stephen's review comments.
 - Misc. cleanups.
