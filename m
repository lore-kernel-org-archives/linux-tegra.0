From: Thierry Reding <treding-DDmLM1+adcrQT0dZR+AlfA@public.gmane.org>

Currently the drivers/power directory almost exclusively contains
drivers implementing the power-supply class. However not all power-
related devices are supplies, so in order to give them an appropriate
home this commit moves supply drivers into a supply subdirectory. That
allows the base directory to be used for drivers that don't depend on
the POWER_SUPPLY symbol.
