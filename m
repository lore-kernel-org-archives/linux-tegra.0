I checked this generic power domain series, it select PM and PM_GENERIC=
_DOMAINS
for Tegra SoC Family. But the soctherm_suspend/resume callbacks defined=
 by
SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS are only used when the CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is enabled, so=
 if the
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is disabled, we still will get this warning.
So to avoid the warning, I think this patch is needed.

Wei.
