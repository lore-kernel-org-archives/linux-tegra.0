True - that could be safe enough.

What about IOVAs though ? I suspect we should reserve the MSI address
range - it looks like there is something missing here.

That definitely needs fixing given that it works by chance.

That's how it should be done then lest it trickles into other drivers
requiring a similar set-up.
