Yes, exactly.

Yes, there are many patch series may have dependency each other
recently. We also want to know what the sequence you expect to merge the
patch series to your tree. Evan my own patch series had dependency too.
For ex, hotplug enhancement, cpuidle, SMP works on UP and
suspend/resume. Currently, I think we are all work the the top of
linux-next tree. If we can't expect the sequence of the patch series to
be merged, we will always have some conflicts with each other.

Depend on the timing, I think it should be better to know which patch
series should be going first or recently and which should go later and
depend on which series. Then we can rearrange our patches on top of it.
And reducing the job to fix conflict on your side.

What do you think, Prashant? If your rework of clock driver will show up
soon and Stephen also expect that will be merged first, I am fine to
re-base on it and re-send my next version after new clock driver be
done.

Thanks,
Joseph
