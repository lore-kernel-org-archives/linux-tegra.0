I see following in my linux box
  Zone ranges:
    DMA      [mem 0x0000000000001000-0x0000000000ffffff]
    DMA32    [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x00000000ffffffff]
    Normal   [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000106effffff]
    Device   empty

and following in my T210 Tegra platform
Zone ranges:
   DMA      [mem 0x0000000080000000-0x00000000ffffffff]
   Normal   [mem 0x0000000100000000-0x000000017fffffff]

It is the same system where MSI memory writes don't really make it to
system memory. But, the addresses mentioned in that patch don't work.
we are working with hardware folks on understanding the issue better.
Meanwhile, using GFP_DMA is giving consistent results and thought this
can be used as a stop gap solution before we figure out a better bus
address to be used as MSI target address.
