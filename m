oh,yes. May be.

OK, the PMIC(Palmas here) only support level-sensitive and default is
active low.

But it was being configured as active high in the Dalmore's DT. And yes,
it can work fine with the configuration you mentioned below. The suspend
mode of LP1/LP2 that could be woken up by IRQ is OK in this case.

But if checking the PMU_INT signal in the schematic of Dalmore, it only
supports active low. It was connected to !PWR_INT of Tegra114 that will
cause the system wake up automatically when syspended to LP0 if active
high.

That's why my change is setting the IRQ type of PMIC to active low and
keep the "nvidia,invert-interrupt". And it can make the LP0/1/2 work
proper.

By the way, don't you see IRQ storm like below(You use "if" here)?
