This was a few years back, so I don't remember the details; it might 
have been as simple as "some bindings don't already have GPIO flags, and 
I'd rather get GPIO regulators implemented first before thinking about 
fixing that" or it could have been "some bindings don't already have 
GPIO flags, and there's ${some reason} why it's not possible to solve 
that in a backwards-compatible fashion" (recalling that DT bindings must 
evolve in a backwards-compatible fashion since they're an ABI). 
Unfortunately, you'd have to read through the mailing list posts related 
to the patches that defined the GPIO regulator bindings or added the 
nodes to DT.

I don't think we can switch to using GPIO flags, without changing the 
compatible values for the relevant DT nodes.

For one, we'd need some way of actively marking the nodes to say whether 
they are written to expect that the GPIO flags or the other properties 
be used. It's not possible in all cases to determine this automatically. 
For example, if enable-active-high it's fairly clear we should honor 
this flag, yet if it's missing does that mean the GPIO is active-low or 
simply that the node was written to expect that the GPIO flags be used 
instead?

Also, old DTs must work with new kernels (and preferably also, new DTs 
must work with old kernels). If the GPIO flags are wrong in current DTs, 
then we can't use them. Of course, there's an argument that the 
backwards-compatibility constraint doesn't apply to buggy DTs, just to 
correctly written DTs. However, if we deliberately chose to make all 
regulator GPIO flags ACTIVE_HIGH, then the current DTs aren't buggy.
