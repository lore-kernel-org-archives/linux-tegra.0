Actually no, this is nothing strange here at all. If you look Tegra has
it's own 'transfer_one_message' handler (tegra_spi_transfer_one_message
in drivers/spi/spi-tegra114.c) and this does not update any of the
statistics. Looks like the statistics are not updated if a SPI
controller has it own transfer_one_message hander which is a shame.

Looks like running is set true on initialising the queue and busy is set
true in __spi_pump_messages().

I definitely see __spi_pump_messages() being called which in turn calls
tegra_spi_transfer_one_message().

Looking some more I think that the problem is ...

1. The controller is put into the 'running' state when spi_start_queue()
is called (which itself is called during the registration of the spi
controller).
2. After sending some messages to initialise the SPI flash,
spi_pump_idle_teardown() is called but exits early because the
controller is in the 'running' state and this prevents 'busy' from being
cleared.
3. On entering suspend spi_stop_queue() is called but the controller is
still in the 'busy' state and so fails to stop.

So the problem I see is that 'busy' is never cleared and before it was.
Furthermore, because 'busy' is never cleared, I see that the SPI
controller is never pm-runtime suspended and cannot be suspended, and so
this will have an impact on power.

With your patch after booting I see ...

$ cat /sys/class/spi_master/spi1/device/power/runtime_status
active

Reverting your patch, after booting I see ...

$ cat /sys/class/spi_master/spi1/device/power/runtime_status
suspended

Does the device you are testing with support runtime-pm? If so what do
you see?

Cheers
Jon
