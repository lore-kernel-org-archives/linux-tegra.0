At the Linaro Connect last week, I was talking to Bj=C3=B6rn, Rajendra and
Stephen more about these related issues.

It definitely seems like we need to progress with this somehow,
meaning we need a solution for being able to associate a device with
more than one PM domain. In that context, I don't think genpd based on
its current design, is a good fit to solve the problem.

Instead I think we need something entirely new (perhaps some code can
be borrowed from genpd), which is more similar to the clock/regulator
framework. In other words, what you also were suggesting in a earlier
reply.
In this way, the driver/subsystem gains full flexibility of managing
its device's PM domains, which seems like the best future-proof
solution.

Kind regards
Uffe
