This binding is quite different to the binding you sent to internal IP 
review. I wonder why it changed? Specific comments below:

I think this should explicitly list the value values of the compatible 
property, rather than being a generic/wildcard description:

- compatible
     Array of strings.
     One of:
   - "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"

If/when this binding supports other SoCs in the future, we'll add more 
entries into that list.

The binding should describe the HW, and not be affected by anything 
"that the client(s) are using". If there are multiple interrupts, we 
should list them all here, from the start.

When revising this, I would consider the following wording canonical:

- interrupt-names
     Array of strings.
     Contains a list of names for the interrupts described by the
     interrupts property. May contain the following entries, in any
     order:
     - "doorbell"
     - "..." (no doubt many more items will be listed here, e.g.
       for semaphores, etc.).
     Users of this binding MUST look up entries in the interrupts
     property by name, using this interrupts-names property to do so.
- interrupts
     Array of interrupt specifiers.
     Must contain one entry per entry in the interrupt-names property,
     in a matching order.

This property wasn't in the internal patch.

This doesn't make sense. The HW feature-set is fixed. This sounds like 
some kind of software configuration option, or a way to allow different 
drivers to handle different aspects of the HW? In general, the binding 
shouldn't be influenced by software structure. Please delete this property.

Now, if you're attempting to set up a binding where each function 
(semaphores, shared mailboxes, doorbells, etc.) has a different DT node, 
then (a) splitting up HW modules into sub-blocks has usually turned out 
to be a mistake in the past, and (b) the differences should likely be 
represented by using a different compatible property for each 
sub-component, rather than via a custom property.


The following properties were included in the internal patch:

                 nvidia,num-SM = <0x8>;
                 nvidia,num-AS = <0x2>;
                 nvidia,num-SS = <0x2>;
                 nvidia,num-DB = <0x7>;
                 nvidia,num-SI = <0x8>;

... yet aren't here. True the compatible value implies those values; was 
that why the properties were removed?

I'd suggest not including the bpmp node in the example, since it's not 
part of the HSP node. If you do, recall that bpmp has no reg property 
and hence the node name shouldn't include a unit address.

This file should probably be named tegra186-hsp, since I doubt the 
master ID values will be stable between chips.

That should say "186" not "<chip>"

The two changes mentioned above would be consistent with that include 
guard's name including the text "186".

I think those should be removed, along with the nvidia,hsp-function 
property.
