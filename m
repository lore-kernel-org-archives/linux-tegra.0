Thanks for the clarification. The hardware is definitely capable of >
32 bits addressing (how much more exactly, I still have to figure out
as Stephen pointed out). Parent bus is the platform bus (root node in
the DT) so I'm not too sure how the dma-ranges property should be used
in that case (as of today we have no dma-ranges property at all in
Tegra DTs). We could maybe specify it at the root level (I see at
least one arm device doing that), but then we need to make sure every
platform device supports the same range.

Actually even if we specify a dma-ranges on the parent DT node, the
DMA range will still be limited to 32 bits because of the following
code in of_dma_configure():

    /*
     * Set default coherent_dma_mask to 32 bit.  Drivers are expected to
     * setup the correct supported mask.
     */
    if (!dev->coherent_dma_mask)
        dev->coherent_dma_mask = DMA_BIT_MASK(32);

    /*
     * Set it to coherent_dma_mask by default if the architecture
     * code has not set it.
     */
    if (!dev->dma_mask)
        dev->dma_mask = &dev->coherent_dma_mask;

    ....
    /* gets dma-ranges into dma_addr and size */
    ....


    *dev->dma_mask = min((*dev->dma_mask),
                 DMA_BIT_MASK(ilog2(dma_addr + size)));

So unless the DMA mask is set on the device before of_dma_configure()
is called, the min() statement will choose the 32 bits mask that has
been previously set. So IIUC in any case, the driver will need to call
dma_set_mask()

Can I have your thoughts on this? Am I missing something?
