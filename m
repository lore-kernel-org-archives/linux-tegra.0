That is a very good point.  My experience with SDHCI was that masking the
"Data Timeout Error Status Enable" and "Data Timeout Error Signal Enable
" bits did not disable the timeout i.e. the host controller would not
deliver a TC interrupt if the erase exceeded the timeout.

What happens on your board?
