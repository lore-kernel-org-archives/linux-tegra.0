And how long does that really take?  Numbers please :)

Based on the time it takes a modern laptop to boot, 2 seconds is
forever, there has to be something else going on here other than just
calling probe() a bunch of times.  Please use the tools we have to
determine this before trying to change the driver core.

People seem to not like the noise, so let's turn off those messages,
that should speed things up :)
