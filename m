ION is more of a physical memory allocator supporting buddy pages as
well as memory reserved at boot-time. DMA type of heap is only one of
the types
of heap. For system heap, ION provides an sg_table which device will
have to map it using iommu API to get dma_address for the device. Even
for DMA type of heap, each device will have to map the pages to its
own iommu as Arnd mentioned.
