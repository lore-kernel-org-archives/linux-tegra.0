I perfectly understand your proposal and spent a lot of time trying to
debug such kind issues also (and using printks).  

But I worry a bit (and that my main point) about these few additional
rounds of deferred device probing which I have right now and which allows
some of drivers to finish, finally, their probes successfully.
With proposed change I'll get more messages in boot log, but some of
them will belong to drivers which have been probed successfully and so,
they will be not really useful.

As result, I think, the most important thing is to identify (or create)
some point during kernel boot when it will be possible to say that all
built-in drivers (at least) finish their probes 100% (done or defer).

Might be do_initcalls() can be updated (smth like this):
static void __init do_initcalls(void)
{
	int level;

	for (level = 0; level < ARRAY_SIZE(initcall_levels) - 1; level++)
		do_initcall_level(level);

+	wait_for_device_probe();
+	/* Now one final round, reporting any devices that remain deferred */
+	driver_deferred_probe_report = true;
+	driver_deferred_probe_trigger();
+	wait_for_device_probe();
}

Also, in my opinion, it will be useful if this debugging feature will be optional.

Thanks.
