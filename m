That's fine if we have one SMR per ID, but the moment we want to do more
involved matching, we're going to need complete system knowledge prior to
the first attach. I don't think we can safely reconfigure live streams on
the fly.

That sounds like a sane use-case. The best thing to do would be to add
some ARM page-table code as a library under drivers/iommu/, then we can
move the ARM IOMMUs over to using that. Since we'd be moving away from the
CPU page table helpers, we could also take the opportunity to use the
coherent DMA API instead of the hack I currently use for flushing out tables
to non-coherent walkers.
