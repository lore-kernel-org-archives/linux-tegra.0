This series converts the Tegra device tree files to use the new feature
of running cpp over .dts files before compiling them with dtc. This
allows GPIOs and other GPIO/IRQ specifier cells to be named for example.

As far as merging goes, I'd anticipate the first 3 patches being useful
to any other ARM sub-arch that wants to convert; perhaps they could go
through some arm-soc common branch. The next 2 patches are Tegra-specific
cleanup that I'd anticipate applying to Tegra's for-3.10/cleanup. The
rest of the patches depend on those 5 previous patches, so would need to
go into a Tegra branch that merges in the previous patches; I'd anticipate
calling it for-3.10/dtc-cpp say.

One issue this raises: The first 2 patches aren't ARM-specific. I put the
files they create into arch/arm/boot/dts, but I wonder if they wouldn't be
better in some arch-agnostic include directory, or even right with the
binding documentation in Documentation/devicetree/bindings. Moving the
files would require adjusting the cpp include path.
