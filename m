Alright, so here's all the results I got all based on
next-20171109 and running on tegra124-nyan-big:

   * plain multi_v7_defconfig, passes:
     https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/981295

   * CONFIG_MODULES disabled, fails:
     https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/981342

   * CONFIG_MODULES and CONFIG_DRM_NOUVEAU disabled, also fails:
     https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/981343

   * CONFIG_MODULES disabled and 371435f78 [0] reverted, also fails:
     https://lava.collabora.co.uk/scheduler/job/981353


What I could try to run next is a bisection with CONFIG_MODULES
disabled between when the DRM branch got merged (so the first
crash should be fixed) and next-20171109.
