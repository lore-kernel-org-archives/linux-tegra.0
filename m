Right, especially for controllers using SDCLK as timeout clock.
I'm a bit suspect the timeout supported by host whether is designed
for erase operation
since they have huge gap.
For IMX, when running on 198Mhz for a SD3.0 cards, the max_discard_to is 1355ms.
However, i have one Toshiba SDHC U1 card which ERASE_OFFSET is 2s.
That means our host has no chance to support discard for such card.

Now, i'm think for those host controller with limited timeout time, if we should
use CMD13 to polling the status instead of using HW timeout machanism.
And actuall the mmc core already has some base code to support it.
The timeout is 10 seconds.

See mmc_do_erase function and
/* If the device is not responding */
#define MMC_CORE_TIMEOUT_MS     (10 * 60 * 1000) /* 10 minute timeout */
