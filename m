That doesn't really make sense; The BT and MODEM team should only care
about the specific UARTs they use.

That seems a little unlikely; why can't different boards use different
UARTs for different purposes; after all, UARTA is often a debug UART not
a BT or MODEM UART.

Still, there is some precedent in the kernel for your approach. So, I
guess we can go ahead with using the aliases as-is.

Your approach breaks down in the following scenarios though:

a) Somebody (random customer board designer or SW engineer, who NVIDIA
can't control) wants the console UART to always have alias serial0;
there are examples of this in the kernel. On just the boards we support
upstream, some use UART A for the debug/console and some use UART D. I
know of others that use UART B.

b) The board contains UARTs (e.g. PCIe) that aren't the Tegra-internal
UARTs, so the alias IDs can't all map to Tegra UART IDs.

c) Conceptually, the purpose of aliases seems to be to provide useful
names (numbers) for the relevant ports, and naming/numbering
non-existent ports doesn't seem particularly useful.
