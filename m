I think we should expect all non-host PCI bridges to behave according to the
normal PCI spec and get handled by the PCI core.

There are some handlers for broken bridges in drivers/pci/quirks.c, which
is not nice but there is little alternative, and I don't think that
hooking into the PCI host bridge driver code would help here.
