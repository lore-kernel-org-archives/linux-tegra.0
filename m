I assume that should be movtne.

I think adding that code back would make sense. It would mean the code
works fundamentally the same way for all SoCs.

BTW, you mentioned that LP1 resume takes 10-15 seconds on Dalmore. Are
you sure this isn't because the above code is missing, and hence the CPU
keeps running at 32KHz or the crystal speed, since nothing restores the
CPU clock source until much later, when the syscore op runs?

I still have absolutely no idea why Tegra30 and Tegra114 are different.

You mentioned something about this low-level code only manipulating the
IDLE state, and the clock driver needing to restore the other 4 states.
This raises yet more questions:

1) Do we not need to restore the other 4 states on Tegra30? If not, why
not? If we do, presumably Tegra30 (and Tegra20?) need to the syscore_op
this patch series adds to Tegra114 only? If we don't, then why does
Tegra114 have to restore them?

2) What triggers the HW to switch from IDLE to RUN state? In other
words, I think you're saying that the existing Tegra30 code:

	mov32	r4, ((1 << 28) | (0x8))	@ burst policy is PLLX
	str	r4, [r0, #CLK_RESET_CCLK_BURST]

doesn't change the clock rate right away. When does it change?

Related, when tegra30_switch_cpu_to_clk32k() sets the CPU clock source
for the IDLE state to clk_s, when does that switch actually take place?
That function appears to assume it happens immediately, since it
immediately disables the PLLs that might have been the previous CPU
clock source. Perhaps this is what the MSELECT register writes do?  I
guess not since there's only 1 MSELECT write in tegra_lp1_reset() and
two changes of CPU clock source.
