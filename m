Last time I checked the PM domain code didn't seem like a good fit. I'll
go recheck and see if I can make it work.

One minor issue with putting the driver in drivers/power is that that
directory is only built when POWER_SUPPLY is selected. And since this
isn't really a power supply driver at all, either we need to change the
drivers/Makefile to descend unconditionally or we need to find another
home.

I'll see if I can come up with yet another generic binding for this in
an attempt to move this out of arch/arm/mach-tegra...

Note that we already have all these drivers and they do work for earlier
Tegra generations. My attempt to move these out of arch/arm/mach-tegra
is merely about being able to share them with upcoming 64-bit variants.
So it's not about adding new functionality but rather about keeping the
existing level of functionality on 64-bit.

I'm not a fan of the syscon/regmap approach at all and the existing
drivers use a higher-level API already, so I think we're going to stick
with that.
