Very true.

Yes, this sounds sensible. I'll make such a patch. I suppose having 
another timings table in the MC node with just the rate and 
mc-burst-data would separate the concerns best. It occurs to me that we 
could also write the regs in the pre-rate change notifier, but this 
would turn the dependency around and would mean that the regs are not 
written when entering backup rates. The latter shouldn't be a problem 
but the reversed dependency would, so I guess a custom function is the 
way to go, and we need to add at least one anyway.

The downstream kernel also overwrites most LA registers during EMC rate 
change without regard for the driver-set values, and we might have to 
read those values from the device tree too. Upstream can do this in rate 
change notifiers if needed. I'll look into this a bit more.
