Hi Thierry,

to wrap up this thread, why an address from the PCI aperture and
not a host bridge register ?

I CC'ed Ryder so that he can explain to me please what:

PCIE_MSI_VECTOR and PCIE_IMSI_ADDR offsets in:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/pci/host/pcie-mediatek.c?h=v4.14

register space represent (IIUC the driver uses:

virt_to_phys(port->base + PCIE_MSI_VECTOR);

as MSI doorbell address, which is wrong anyway as Robin explained, just
want to understand how that register was chosen - it is never written or
read in the driver so it is hard to figure that out) to understand
whether the approach can be replicated instead of relying on GFP_DMA
for pages allocation.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
