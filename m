There's no reason that the root filesystem has to be on SD/MMC. Either
way, the DT binding shouldn't be influenced by the root fs location at all.

I think more explanation of exactly what this property does and why is
required.

I assume that's bits, so 2 cells? To be clear: the document needs to
include this information, not just this email thread.

How and why? A complete explanation of how the SMMU and PMC are expected
to interact is required.

The PMC DT binding should include all information related to the PMC;
the binding definitions probably shouldn't expect a PMC driver to go
grovelling in an SMMU node to find information.

I thought there had already been a patch to do this rename. Was it not
complete? If so, that work should probably be completed.

Shouldn't the map just be an "unsigned long map[]" then, so no casts are
needed anywhere? Equally, that pointer could just be passed to the
function rather than copying the data to the stack?
