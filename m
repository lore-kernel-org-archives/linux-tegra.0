I think yes, it can be dropped, but this would require:
1. Fixing any dependencies on HAS_IOMEM, e.g.:
    WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for MFD_SYSCON
      Depends on [n]: HAS_IOMEM [=n]
      Selected by [y]:
      - PHY_DA8XX_USB [=y] && (ARCH_DAVINCI_DA8XX || COMPILE_TEST [=y])

2. Checking if all of stubs are implemented (not only IOMEM but maybe
   DMA as well). Also 1bcbfbfdeb00 brought only few stubs. Still we
   need devm_ioremap_resource() and others.

Quick test shows mentioned "unmet direct dependencies" and:
    phy-pxa-usb.c:(.text+0x2f5): undefined reference to `devm_ioremap_resource'
    dma-iommu.c:(.text+0x179): undefined reference to `dma_pgprot'

You're right, I missed this. None of them require OF for building so
separate "depends on OF" makes sense only for readability of this.  Let
me send v2 to make it similar to PWM_MXS.
