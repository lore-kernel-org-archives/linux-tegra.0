I don't know - the description doesn't make it clear.  Surely, what you
checked was that this file is _not_ included in any file which is built
when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE is disabled.  In other words, when CONFIG_CPU_IDLE
is not defined, arm_cpuidle_simple_enter() is never referenced.

If that is the case, then it's just that the patch description is the
opposite of what it should be for this patch - and then the patch and
description match and I don't see any reason to say no to it.

Then comes the issue of who takes the patch.  It looks like Rafael
would like me to.  I'm fine with that, but it will need to go into the
patch system as I'm rather busy catching up with email, and I expect
to be catching up for at least the rest of this month.
