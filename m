Yeah HS200 is definilty not supported by the controller and really
should not be used.

So you tried timing spec 1 (mmc HS)?

How did you exactly enable mmc-hs mode?

I suggest to *not set* vqmmc and apply patch 1. It will report that
signaling voltage is 3.3V, but that did not really matter in our case.
This was our baseline and always worked stable on mainline. I also would
use that mode when tweaking pinmux etc...

Ok.

I know, I have one sitting here too. I only tried to tinker a bit at the
very beginning...

That is what we saw too. With Apalis/Colibri T30 L4T downstream kernel
(which is 3.1 with quite some patches) 52MHz DDR worked fine,
surprisingly even with ACMD23. However, speed is slightly slower than
mainline 52MHz without ACMD23...
