OK, that makes sense.

I assume you're using CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB but not CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT.

That makes sense; that's the value in the .dts file you posted.

It's not "ignored" as such.

When booting without DT, the machine descriptor in board-paz00.c is used,
since the descriptor is selected based on the machine ID in the descriptor,
and that descriptor includes:

	.fixup          = tegra_paz00_fixup,

... which causes that fixup function to be called.

When booting with DT, the machine descriptor in board-dt.c is used, since
the descriptor is selected based on the DT's overall compatible property,
and that descriptor doesn't refer to tegra_paz00_fixup() at all, so it's
not called.

At this point, I'd argue that exposing the full 512M to the kernel /is/
what we want. There is no Tegra GPU support in the mainline kernel at
present. As such, I'd argue that we should give the entire RAM space to
the kernel to use. As and when we add GPU support to the kernel, we can
use an appropriate mechanism to take RAM away from the kernel for that
purpose.

So, I'm planning to remove all the /memreserve/ entries from the Tegra
.dts files as soon as I can find a minute to do so.

But, as Grant mentioned, the /memreserve/ .dts directive should work
right now to reserve memory. I'm not sure if you'd tried that and it didn't
work? If so, it'd be good to debug that just to make sure the mechanism
works, even if we don't intend to use it.
