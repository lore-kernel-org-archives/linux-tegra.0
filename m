Any crazy circuit design that would make the regular power sequence not usable 
on a specific board. Sorry, I don't have any concrete example in mind, the 
above is just speculation.

Right. Note that this framework is supposed to be extended - I would like to 
at least add regulator voltage setting, and maybe even support for clocks and 
pinmux (but that might be out of place).

You're definitely right about the powering issue being a device issue 99% of 
the time. For the rest I do not have enough insight to emit an opinion.
