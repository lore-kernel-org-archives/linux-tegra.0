The main reason is that the samsung keyboard driver already implements
the more verbose one, and allowing that binding to coexist while also
providing a more compact one seems like the right thing to do.

The row/column format is closer to how the hardware is actually
behaving, and it's trivial to remap that to the kind of
two-dimensional array like Simon provides (it's already done in the
input layer). It also has the benefit of not using up space for
undefined keys.

Since there is no concept of modifier keys in hardware (they are just
keypress events), the translation table should be in the u-boot
implementation instead of in the binding.

There is already precedence to using the linux key code format instead
of character encodings in keyboard maps, and the reasoning behind it
is quite sane: Since it's a userspace-exported interface it is a
stable one. If we went with the array that Simon proposed, there will
need to be a transition layer in the kernel device tree parser to
remap everything back, with very little to no benefit when it comes to
the usability of the binding, as far as I can tell.

It is also a little unclear to me whether that binding should be
localized or not, which would add another level of headaches when it
comes to reverse-mapping the character array back to linux key
bindings, since then you would also need to provide one remapping
table per locale supported.
