Perhaps it was, apologize for my ignorance in that case.

Then, isn't that quite what you already started hacking on in $subject
series? What's the new thing in your previous reply?

However, I was under the impression that Rafael preferred another way
- but again I might have missed his point.

Yes, agree! To me this is the only solution what would really work.

Perhaps Rafael can confirm that he is fine with a solution like this?

Kind regards
