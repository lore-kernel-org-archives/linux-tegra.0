While noted, this does not impact the code quality or review process for an
entirely new feature. That context would be relevant for a localized fix or
system quirk, but it is not applicable here.

The current rationale isn't entirely clear to me. Windows historically favors
ACPI over native SCMI, meaning that supporting a proprietary vendor protocol
would require non-native workarounds potentially hidden within interfaces like
PEP. I am skeptical of this architectural direction. Since Android leverages
the Linux kernel and already manages this through vendor modules, maintaining
those as modules seems like the optimal path until we agree on the interface
that can be merged.

Given that this patch series has been under discussion for nearly two years,
please provide a summary of the feedback that has already been incorporated
to address these concerns just for sake of argument and in your defence.

To clarify, the vendor protocol space is strictly intended for
platform-specific functionalities that cannot be standardized; it should not
be used to bypass standardization for convenience. It appears no evaluation
was done to determine if or why the standard performance protocol was
insufficient. Had that assessment occurred, I would expect the proposed
interface to align much more closely with the standard definitions as I
previously mentioned.

The core issue here is that the proposed vendor protocol interface has been
presented as a finished product without open discussion or a willingness to
iterate based on upstream feedback. This approach bypasses standard
development processes.

IMO these vendor protocol interfaces must be debated on the mailing list prior
to finalization, similar to the 'code-first' prototyping model used for new
ACPI specifications or SCMI early prototyping. If an interface is developed
in isolation and then submitted with an expectation of immediate acceptance
without modification, we cannot approve it. I recommend we pivot to an open
review of the interface design itself.

This is precisely why I previously suggested defining MEMLAT as its own
distinct protocol. Doing so maintains architectural consistency and adheres to
core SCMI principles.
