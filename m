Yes, what you describe is exactly what I had in mind. I've been thinking
about a possible implementation and there may be some details that could
prove difficult to resolve. For instance, we likely need to pass context
around for the MSI ops, or else make sure that they can find the context
=66rom the struct pci_dev or by traversing upwards from it.

I think for the case where the MSI hardware is controlled by the same
driver as the PCI host bridge, doing this is easy because the context
could be part of the PCI host bridge context, which in case of Tegra is
stored in struct pci_bus' sysdata field (which is actually an ARM struct
pci_sys_data and in turn stores a pointer to the struct tegra_pcie in
the .private_data field). Other drivers often just use a global variable
assuming that there will only ever be a single instance of the PCI host
bridge.

If the MSI controller is external to the PCI host bridge, things get a
little more complicated. The easiest way would probably be to store the
context along with the PCI host bridge context and use simple wrappers
around the actual implementations to retrieve the PHB context and pass
the attached MSI context.

Maybe this could even be made more generic by adding a struct msi_ops *
along with a struct msi_chip * in struct pci_bus. Perhaps I should try
and code something up to make things more concrete.
