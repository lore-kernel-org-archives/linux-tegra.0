If you look at the proposed binding in isolation, I think it *is* cleaner
than the ARM SMMU binding (I've acked it...) and I believe it's more
consistent with the way we describe linkages elsewhere.

However, the issue you're raising is that it's more difficult to make use of
in a Linux IOMMU driver. The reward you'll get for using it will come
eventually when the DMA ops are automatically swizzled for devices using the
generic binding.

My plan for the ARM SMMU driver is:

  (1) Change ->probe() to walk the device-tree looking for all masters with
      phandles back to the SMMU instance being probed

  (2) For each master, extract the Stream IDs and add them to the internal
      SMMU driver data structures (an rbtree per SMMU instance). For
      hotpluggable buses, we'll need a way for the bus controller to
      reserve a range of IDs -- this will likely be a later extension to
      the binding.

  (3) When we get an ->add() call, warn if it's a device we haven't seen
      and reject the addition.

That way, ->attach() should be the same as it is now, I think.

Have you tried implementing something like that? We agreed that (1) isn't
pretty, but I don't have a good alternative and it's only done at
probe-time.

BTW: Is the msm-v0 IOMMU compatible with the ARM SMMU driver, or is it a
completely different design requiring a different driver?
