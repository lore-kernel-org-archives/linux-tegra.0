It's quite common I think, many platforms have an intimate
relation between GPIO and muxes/altfunctions. For example
it is common that the hardware engineer doesn't helpfully
enable on-die pull-ups on the I2C bus even though the I2C
block is muxed in, you have to go in and set the pull-up bits
separately from muxing the I2C in...

Basically it's expected from a generic pad I/O cell being
arrayed into a GPIO block to expose these things in the same
set of registers.

I made some presentation last week partly describing how
some hardware engineers I know go about creating GPIO
controllers from simpler I/O pad cells:
