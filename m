Yes please.

So you want to be able to rely on an emulated console (running on a
totally different subsystem) to dump development-phase early-boot
logs? At the cost of legitimizing busy looping in atomic context - one
random driver messing up the api for ever. Maybe you could have the
ring buffer in some shmem and only pass the number of valid characters
in it, to the remote?

It would help if other maintainers chime in if a subsystem should
support busy-wait in atomic context for a one-off driver.
