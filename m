That sounds reasonable.

Ok. Sounds like there might be some use for a temporary "work in
progress" branch for linux-next for patches that are nearly ready to
go but not quite that needs air time, but not really for anything
beyond that.

None of the ones in this case apply to this scenario so I'll resend a
fresh pull request based on -rc3 as soon as the branch rebase has
propagated out from master.kernel.org.
