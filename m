Yes, frequency can be changed anytime but by the same process who has=20
acquired the channel. So if a process is already running/using the channel,
same process can only modify the frequency.

Understood to upgrade pwm-tegra driver with using .apply()
I will work on this with a new change request soon.

Discussed above with my understanding. Please help me understand if=20

I will update this calculation in the probe since max_frequency value is
Different for each chip. Also please note that at this point the rate is no=
t
the actual pwm output rate. It's just a reference for what should be the
source clock rate and then requested with clk_set_rate();
Actual rounding is required while setting pwm controller output rate is
done later down in same function.=20

The if part is for SoCs which have single channel per pwm instance. i.e. T1=
86,=20
T194 etc. For controllers with single channel, dynamic clock rate configura=
tion
is possible. The other part is for legacy controller which has multiple cha=
nnels
for single pwm instance. The pwm controllers having multiple channels share
the source clock. So it does not allow dynamic clock configuration since it
will affect users on the other channels.

Explained above and will move the calculation to probe.=20

Yes, PWM controller is capable to provide 100% duty cycle.
Bits 30:16 are dedicated for pulse width out of which only 24:16 (9 bits)
are used. Only 8 bits are usable [23:16] for varying pulse width.
To achieve 100% duty cycle, Bit [24] needs to be programmed of this
register to 1'b1.

Yes, you are right. The comment needs a correction. It will be plus 1=20
instead of minus 1. I will update the comment in the follow up patch.
Otherwise the calculation is correct.
rate =3D DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL(100ULL * rate, hz);
here rate is the divider value to be set.

Yes, it allows to write the bit during any active and inactive time of the
width. Hence the pwm gets disabled as soon as the enable bit is set to 0.
