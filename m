What I also tried before was to implement busy looping within the
->send_data() callback of the driver so that we didn't have to put this
into the core. Unfortunately, however, the ->send_data() callback is
called under chan->lock, which means that from mbox_send_message() we
don't have a way to mark the transfer as done. In order to do that we'd
have to call mbox_chan_txdone(), but that ends up calling tx_tick() and
that in turn also attempts to take the chan->lock, which would cause a
deadlock.

The explicit flushing is the best alternative that I could come up with.
I think it's not all that hacky, because it's very explicit about what's
going on and it has the nice side-effect that it will allow the mailbox
to work in interrupt driven mode if possible and only resorting to the
busy loop in atomic context.

At this point I think I have explored all other options and I frankly
can't find a more proper way to achieve what we need here. Perhaps you
can think of additional ways to accomplish this?
