This basically is about setup, because after that point all should
just work in both cases.

Personally, I would do

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM)) {
  do setup based on pm-runtime
} else {
  do manual setup
}

So why don't you do

if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM)) {
  do manual clock setup
}

here?

Well, people do pm_runtime_resume() in ->probe() too, but
pm_runtime_resume() returns 1 for CONFIG_PM unset, so that won't give
you what you want anyway. :-)
