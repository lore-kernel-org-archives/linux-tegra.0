I see your point and it is interesting. The trouble is that we would
need to test every memory client in every power domain to prove this. So
I don't think that is a trivial thing to do. Furthermore, looking at
what we have done in kernel used for android products (which probably
stress PM the most) this is done and so I don't know of any shipping
product that stresses PM that does not do this. May be someone else
might. I personally would not be comfortable removing this without
testing, but as I mentioned it is not a trivial thing to test correctly.
However, I will let you and the other maintainers decide what's best here.
