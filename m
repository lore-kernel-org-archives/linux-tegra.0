Yes, with the first way, the DRM driver will have to call
of_platform_populate() recursively to make this work.

The thing here is that the device tree should model hardware, not be
designed purely to match the device registration needs of the DRM
driver. I'm not sure that it's correct to model all those devices as
children of the top-level graphics object; I /think/ all the devices are
flat on a single bus, and hence not children of each-other. That all
said, I guess having the nodes as children isn't too far off how the HW
is designed (even if the register accesses aren't on a child bus, the
modules at least logically are grouped together in an umbrella
situation), so I wouldn't push back on the first option above that you
prefer.

Why wouldn't the default be to light up all outputs that have an
attached display, or an algorithm something like:

* If internal LCD is present, use that
* Else, if HDMI display plugged in, use that

So the device tree for those devices would disable (or not include) the
connectors that were not present on the board.

That looks like a reasonable start.

I think a binary blob makes sense - that's the exact same format it'd
have if read over the DDC I2C bus.
