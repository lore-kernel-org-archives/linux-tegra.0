I discussed this with Rafael at the OSPM summit in Pisa a couple of
weeks ago. Apologize for the delay in providing additional feedback.

First, whether the problem is really rare, perhaps adding a new
API/framework can't be justified - then it may be better to add some
kind of aggregation layer on top of the current PM domain
infrastructure (something along the first attempt you made for genpd).
That was kind of Rafael's thoughts (Rafael, please correct me if I am
wrong).

However, we currently know about at least two different SoCs that need
this. Perhaps we can extend the below list to justify adding a new
framework/APIs. Something along the lines what you propose in $subject
patchset.

1) Nvidia; to solve the USB super-speed host/device problem.
2) QCOM, which has pointed to several cases where the PM topology is
laid out like devices having two PM domains..
3?) I don't fully remember - but I think Geert also pointed to some
examples where a device could reside in a clock domain but also in
power domain for a Renesas SoC!?
4) ?

Moreover, perhaps this could also be useful for SoCs using ACPI? If
so, we shouldn't tie this immediately to genpd, but in the layer above
genpd/ACPI PM domain. Something like dev_pm_domain_get(), which would
be implemented similar as the dev_pm_domain_attach() (which calls both
the ACPI PM domain and genpd to find a match).

Kind regards
