Felipe, Would it be possible to apply this patch to a topic branch, so
that I can merge it into the Tegra tree? The reason is that I'd like to
remove Tegra's devices.[ch] in kernel 3.7, but to do that, I need to
move a tiny chunk of code out of that file somewhere else, and doing
that relies on adding a #include to usb_phy.h/tegra_usb_phy.h, which is
renamed in this patch.

Alternatively, if you don't think it'll cause any merge conflicts with
the USB PHY tree, I can just take this patch through the Tegra tree if
you want. Venu, do you plan any other patches within the next couple
weeks or so (i.e. before 3.6-rc6) that will depend on this patch? If so,
taking it only through the Tegra tree might not work so well.

Thanks.
