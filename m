This is because of the table right after these includes:

static const struct power_seq_res_ops power_seq_ops[POWER_SEQ_NUM_TYPES] = {
	[POWER_SEQ_DELAY] = POWER_SEQ_DELAY_TYPE,
	[POWER_SEQ_REGULATOR] = POWER_SEQ_REGULATOR_TYPE,
	[POWER_SEQ_PWM] = POWER_SEQ_PWM_TYPE,
	[POWER_SEQ_GPIO] = POWER_SEQ_GPIO_TYPE,
};

The POWER_SEQ_*_TYPE macros are defined in the C files. It's the 
simplest way to initialize this table, and the code inside these C files 
is short and simple enough that I thought I would be forgiven. :)

At first everything was in power_seq.c and it was fine, then I thought 
it would be better to move resource support code into their own filesm 
and now everybody is asking. :P

But yeah, maybe it would be even better to not stop halfway and use 
dynamic linking.

Comment added for the time being. ;)

Fair enough - but is that a convention? checkpatch.pl was happy with these.

Thanks,
