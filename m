From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

The PCI host bridge found on Tegra SoCs doesn't require the MSI target
address to be backed by physical system memory. Writes are intercepted
within the controller and never make it to the memory pointed to.

Since no actual system memory is required, remove the allocation of a
single page and hardcode the MSI target address with a special address
on a per-SoC basis. Ideally this would be an address to an MMIO memory
region (such as where the controller's register are located). However,
those addresses don't work reliably across all Tegra generations. The
only set of addresses that work consistently are those that point to
external memory.

This is not ideal, since those addresses could technically be used for
DMA and hence be confusing. However, the first page of external memory
is unlikely to be used and special enough to avoid confusion.

Changes in v2:
- use physical base address of system memory as MSI target address

Vidya, Manikanta,

I've tested this on all of Tegra20, Tegra30, Tegra124, Tegra210 and
Tegra186, so I'm confident that this is finally a good set of addresses.
However, it'd be good to get confirmation from you since we had
conflicting test results the last time around.

Thanks,
Thierry
