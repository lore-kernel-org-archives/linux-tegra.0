I meant the actual physical bus. AXI buses that are typically used
can have either 32-bit or 64-bit addressing, but IIRC they wouldn't
have anything inbetween based on the way this protocol works (i.e.
not an actual set of address wires, but a data packet getting sent
around on a point to point link).

I think there is still a bug in the code that will lead to
dma_set_mask just succeeding, regardless of what the bus supports,
and this should really really be fixed.

I think it will just keep working for platforms that accidentally
don't set the dma-ranges property, but it may be slower as we fall
back to swiotlb.

Yes, the driver definitely has to call dma_set_mask(), the property of
the parent bus is used to make that fail when the bus doesn't support
it.

One point: I think the dma_set_mask() probably should be in the
generic part of the sdhci driver, not the tegra specific portion.

I also forget how this really needs to interact with swiotlb. I know
we have discussed this a couple of times, but the result currently
is lost to me.
Maybe the answer was that if swiotlb or iommu are enabled, then
dma_set_mask() should always succeed, but the mask should not actually
be updated?
