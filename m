Hello,

This series adds support for CPU frequency/voltage scaling on Tegra20/30,
it adds device tree support that allow to specify clock rate/voltages per
board and to implement thermal throttling. The tegra20-cpufreq driver has
been re-worked to support that all.

Note that this series depends on in-progress clock [0] and regulator [1]
patches.

Changelog:

v2:
    - Implemented DVFS support. Currently only CPU rail changes voltage,
      while CORE/RTC locked to maximum. The CORE can be unlocked once all
      of peripheral drivers will gain support for DVFS. See "TODO" comment
      in the driver. On Tegra20 CPU temperature is lower by 5-6 C during
      idling with DVFS. On Tegra30 CPU temperature is lower by 1-2 C, and
      it drops by 6-7 C if CORE rail scaling is unlocked.

    - Device-tree binding has been reworked to support voltage regulators
      and HW versioning. Now CPU OPP's are specified per HW version and
      include voltage entry. OPP values are taken from downstream kernel
      [2][3]. The "backup" clock has been renamed to "intermediate".
