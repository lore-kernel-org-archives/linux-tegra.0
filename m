I recall you mentioning TTM as a better alternative several times in the
past. How does it fit in with this? Does it have the capability of using
a predefined chunk of contiguous memory as a pool to allocate from?

One problem that all of these solutions don't address is that not all
devices below host1x are DRM related. At least for the CSI and VI blocks
I expect there to be V4L2 drivers eventually, so what we really need is
to manage allocations outside of the DRM. host1x is the most logical
choice here.

Perhaps we can put host1x code somewhere below drivers/gpu (mm
subdirectory?), drivers/memory or perhaps some other or new location
that could eventually host similar drivers for other SoCs.

Then again, maybe it'd be easier for now to put everything below the
drivers/gpu/drm/tegra directory and cross that bridge when we get to it.

CMA certainly sounds like the most simple approach. While it may not be
suited for 3D graphics or multimedia processing later on, I think we
could use it at a starting point to get basic framebuffer and X support
up and running. We can always move to something more advanced like TTM
later.
