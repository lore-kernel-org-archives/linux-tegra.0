That certainly matches what I recall from the ARM minisummit.

The ARM SMMU refers to these as "stream IDs", as that's the architected name
that appears in all the hardware documentation. If "swgroup" is the term used
in the hardware documentation I think it makes sense to stick with it, as long
as there's a description in the binding document that points out what an
"swgroup" is. If there's a common term that both binding documents could refer
to to define what stream-id/swgroup are, that would be nice.

There are a few other differences in approach with the current ARM SMMU binding:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/arm,smmu.txt

We should probably begin to look for commonality such that the next iommu
device that gets a binding is closer to a generic iommu class binding.

Assuming that the swgroup values of IP block instances are static, that sounds
like the ARM SMMU binding approach. Are the IDs static, or can they be assigned
at runtime?

Thanks,
Mark.
