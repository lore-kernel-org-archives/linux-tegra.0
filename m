Hi all,

this series implements UHS-I signaling for the Tegra SDHCI host,
which mainly means putting a proper tuning sequence in place.

I've tested this on Jetson TK1 and got the following speed results,
where mmcblk0 is the on-board eMMC and mmcblk1 is a micro SDXC card:

Without series applied:
hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk0
 Timing buffered disk reads:  110 MB in  3.05 seconds =  36.02 MB/sec
hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk1
 Timing buffered disk reads:   56 MB in  3.01 seconds =  18.63 MB/sec
 
With series applied:
hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk0
 Timing buffered disk reads:  236 MB in  3.00 seconds =  78.58 MB/sec
hdparm -t /dev/mmcblk1
 Timing buffered disk reads:  102 MB in  3.04 seconds =  33.51 MB/sec

Tegra 30 does support UHS-I speeds too, but currently has problems
when lowering the card voltage, which is needed in order to switch
to UHS-I signaling. I have some more patches to fix this, but they
need a bit more cleanup, with them applied the gains on Tegra30 are
similar to the results above.

For now the gains are limited to Tegra124+, with no regressions on
Tegra30 and Tegra20.

Regards,
Lucas
