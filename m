In some of NVIDIA Tegra's platform, PWM controller is used to
control the PWM controlled regulators. PWM signal is connected to
the VID pin of the regulator where duty cycle of PWM signal decide
the voltage level of the regulator output.

When system enters suspend, some PWM client/slave regulator devices
require the PWM output to be tristated.

Add DT binding details to provide the pin configuration state
from PWM and pinctrl DT node in suspend and active state of
the system.

+In some of the interface like PWM based regulator device, it is required
+to configure the pins differently in different states, especially in suspend
