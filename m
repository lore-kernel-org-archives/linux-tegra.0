Nope - it only got build-tested, and it's partly why there's soo many
incremental small patches.

Good news.

I don't mind the series being split - there's nothing dependent between
the individual drivers, so all the Tegra SMMU stuff can go through
Joerg's tree if that'll be easiest.

Yes.  There is a question here though:

Is it a good idea to use normal cacheable memory for the IOMMU page table
entries, or would DMA coherent memory be better?

If the latter, then we don't need to do any cache maintanence of the
tables, and all the hacks can go.  If the former, using the streaming
DMA API in all IOMMU drivers would be a good idea, like Tegra SMMU now
does as a result of these patches.
