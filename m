I've found the problem. My bootloader wasn't initializing the TSC and
hence I guess it wasn't working properly, even with Joseph's patch to
add a call to the initialization function.

So, if I:

a) Fix my bootloader to enable TSC.

b) Merge Rob's patch series to enable the TSC. This is needed rather
than Joseph's patch since the two conflict, and I assume that Rob's
patch is going into 3.10.

c) Undo my local revert of "ARM: 7674/1: smp: Avoid dummy clockevent
being preferred over real hardware clock-event".

... then everything now works.

So the only remaining issues are:

1) Should the mux clocks still be defined in the binding document?
Prashant didn't seem to think so.

2) I need Mike's ack to apply this series to the Tegra tree.
