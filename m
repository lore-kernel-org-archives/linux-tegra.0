Keep in mind, that the possibility that a function call ends up with 
initializing a whole bunch of other drivers, is not determined 
statically, but depends on the configuration and runtime behaviour of 
the actual system the on-demand stuff actually happens.

E.g. if driver A is faster one system that driver B, the whole bunch of 
drivers might become initialized by a call in driver A. But if driver B 
was faster on the developers system (or the system is configured to 
first init driver B), than the whole bunch of drivers might have become 
initialized by driver B on the developers system. Thus he never might 
have hit a possible problem when the whole bunch of drivers got 
initialized in driver A.

That means it isn't always a good idea to create dynamic systems (like 
on-demand device initialization), because it's very hard to foresee and 
correctly handle their runtime behaviour.
