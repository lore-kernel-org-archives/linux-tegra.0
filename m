Sounds fine, so long as you do not rebase your branch.

That sounds OK, but it does create some extra work for you.
Alternatively you can just take these patches through your tegra tree
into arm-soc with my Ack (which is the reason I gave it out in the first
place).

However if you have other clock patches which conflict then having the
stable branch makes good sense. The choice is yours since it will be an
extra burden on your to stub things out.
