I didn't think of the edge driven irq case.

I totally agree, disable|enable_irq() can't be used for power management.

I agree, this is exactly the case I have been thinking of.

Closely related to this topic.

Currently there are several cases where subsystems/drivers don't
protects themselves from receiving an IRQ, when the device is in a
quiescent state.
This may lead to hangs at device register accesses etc, especially
when the IRQ handler expects the device to be functional and not in a
low power state.

This is a different issue, but the solution I had in mind was to use
disable|enable_irq() as protection. I now realize that
freeing/re-requesting the IRQ handler is better, as that would
potentially allow power management for the irqchip as well.

I like that idea!

We may also want to distinguish between the PM case and by just having
an IRQ handler registered, for whatever reason.

More importantly, we don't want to introduce unnecessary latencies
when bringing devices back to full power from a quiescent power state.

Perhaps the functions should be named something with "pm" to better
reflect their purpose?

Here's a small collection of drivers that I easily picked up as
candidates for using these new APIs.
In principle, they would invoke these new APIs from their runtime PM callbacks.

drivers/spi/spi-atmel.c
drivers/spi/spi-pl022.c
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-omap.c
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-nomadik.c
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-sh_mobile.c
drivers/mmc/host/mtk-sd.c
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c

Kind regards
