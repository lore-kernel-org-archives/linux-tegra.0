Hi Olof, Georgi,

Happy new year! :-)

[reflowed Georgi's responses]

Agreed that devfreq is not good for this. Like any good driver
framework, the interconnect framework provides a client/consumer api to
device drivers to express their needs (in this case, throughput over a
bus or interconnect).

On modern SoCs these topologies can be quite complicated, which requires
a provider api.

I think that a dedicated framework makes sense for this.

Just FYI, Alex will renew his efforts to port iMX over to this framework
after the new year.

I honestly don't know if this series is ready to be merged or not. I
stopped reviewing it a long time ago. But there is interest in the need
that it addresses for sure.

Detailed SoC glue controlled by Linux is always a nightmare. This typically
falls into the power management bucket: functional clocks and interface clo=
cks,
clock domains, voltage control, scalable power islands (for both idle & act=
ive
use cases), master initiators and slave targets across interconnects,
configuring wake-up capable interrupts and handling them, handling dynamic
dependencies such as register spaces that are not clocked/powered and must =
be
enabled before read/write access, reading eFuses and defining operating poi=
nts
at runtime, and the inevitable "system controllers" that are a grab bag of
whatever the SoC designers couldn't fit elsewhere...

This stuff is all a nightmare to handle in Linux, and upstream Linux still
lacks the expressiveness to address much of it. Until the SoC designers rep=
lace
it all with firmware or a dedicated PM microcontroller or whatever, we'll n=
eed
to model it and implement it as driver frameworks. This is an attempt to do=
 so
upstream, which I support.

Correct, everyone does this out of tree. For example:

https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/linux-imx/tree/arch/arm/mach-imx=
/busfreq-imx.c?h=3Dimx_4.14.62_1.0.0_beta

See you in 2019,
