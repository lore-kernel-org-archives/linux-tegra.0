And that's where things seem to stop working: the driver's probe
function is invoked by the platform bus, *after* of_dma_configure() is
called. So unless I am missing something there is no way for the
driver to set the DMA mask in such a way that of_dma_configure() can
see it and do the right thing.

In other words, most of the DMA mask logic in of_dma_configure()
doesn't seem to have any effect (and a 32 bits mask will be set), at
least on the platform bus.

Ok, but then how does the generic part of the driver knows which DMA
mask applies to the device?
