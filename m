Stephen,

Even though we have plan to use coupled cpuidle, I still prefer to go
with the LP2 driver first. Then adding one more patch to support coupled
cpuidle based on LP2 driver. This is good for history. And if there is
any issue, it's more easy to roll back to the stable one.

There is still one thing you should know. Because we are planning to
upstream "CPUquiet" framework that is a CPU auto hotplug mechanism. It
will auto hotplug the CPUs depends on the system is busy or not. So when
system is idle, there will be only one CPU online (i.e, CPU0). The
secondary CPUs will all be hot plugged (i.e, offline and power gate). We
need to think about do we still need coupled cpuidle on Tegra30 if we
are going to use "CPUquiet".

And Yes, I already had a work version on Tegra20 but I need to iron out
the IPI missing issue first. The LP2 driver of Tegra20 also not yet be
upstreamed.

Thanks,
Joseph
