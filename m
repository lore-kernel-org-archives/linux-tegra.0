There should be at least FIXME in the driver explaining the situation and
I would really prefer to have PM support added when the driver is still
"hot" (meaning there are people actively working on it) instead of possibly
having to chase people months/years later when they have already moved on
and are working on something else.  Please also note that adding PM support
should be quite simple if the driver is designed correctly.
