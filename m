Yes, I think that makes most sense. After all from the IOMMU's point of
view requests from all devices behind the bridge will originate from the
same ID.

So technically it's not really correct to encode the master ID within
each of the devices, but rather they should be inheriting the ID from
the non-transparent bridge.

But that's also a software decision, isn't it? Virtualization doesn't
have anything to do with the hardware description. Or am I missing
something? Of course I guess you could generate a DTB for the guest and
group device together, in which case you're pretty much free to do what
you want since you're essentially defining your own hardware.
