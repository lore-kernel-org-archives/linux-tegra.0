I actually had an implementation at some point that did exactly that. The
problem was that there is no equivalent to of_platform_populate() to call at
module removal, so that when the tegra-drm module was unloaded and reloaded,
it would try to create duplicate devices.

Something ugly can probably be done with device_for_each_child(), but maybe=
 a
better option would be to add a helper to the DT code to explicitly undo the
effects of of_platform_populate() (of_platform_desolate()?).

I suppose these should now also drop the unit addresses to follow your
cleanup patches of the DTS files.

Right, those are relics from the earlier version I mentioned above, where t=
he
other nodes were children of the graphics node.

That makes a lot of sense.

I just took a brief look at it. I'll have to play around with it a bit to s=
ee
how it fits.

I did try setting the enabled field to false, but that broke RGB output. I
didn't have much time to investigate why. Once Tegra moves to the common
clock bindings this should definitely be fixed properly.

Okay, I can do that.
