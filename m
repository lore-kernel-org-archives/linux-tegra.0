I am not saying that.

What I am suggesting is you ...

 if (pc->soc->num_channels == 1) {
         required_clk_rate = (NSEC_PER_SEC / period_ns) <<
                              PWM_DUTY_WIDTH;

         err = clk_set_rate(pc->clk, required_clk_rate);
         if (err < 0)
                return -EINVAL;

         pc->clk_rate = clk_get_rate(pc->clk);
 }

 rate = clk_get_rate(pc->clk) >> PWM_DUTY_WIDTH;

That's all. I think this is simpler.
