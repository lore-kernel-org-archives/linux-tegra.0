The struct smp_operations .cpu_kill/.cpu_die hooks. So, yes.

So the analysis I did, cribbed from our internal bug report so hopefully
it makes sense without any context there, was:

==========
Before that patch (62e930e reboot: "rigrate shutdown/reboot to boot
cpu"), kernel/sys.c:kernel_restart() and kernel_power_off() used to use
CPU hotplug mechanisms to unplug every CPU other than one CPU, then do
the reboot or shutdown. The ARM implementation of machine_restart() and
machine_power_off() both call machine_shutdown() which calls
smp_send_stop(), which IPIs to every CPU to tell it to stop. However,
since all the CPUs were unplugged, this was a no-op.

With the patch, the kernel simply disables scheduling on all CPUs except
logical CPU 0 in kernel_restart() and kernel_power_off(). This
guarantees that the code is running on logical CPU 0, but leaves the
other CPUs still present. Hence, the call to smp_send_stop() from the
ARM code is no longer a no-op. This code hangs.

The implementation of smp_send_stop() raises IPI_CPU_STOP on each CPU
(other than logical CPU 0). This eventually calls down to
tegra_cpu_kill()[1], which calls tegra_wait_cpu_in_reset() which calls
tegra20_wait_cpu_in_reset(). That hangs, because nothing has ever told
the flow controller to put the CPU in reset, so logical CPU 0 waits
indefinitely for this to happen, which is the hang.
==========

[1] Perhaps the issue is why ipi_send_stop() calls down into
tegra_cpu_kill() rather than tegra_cpu_die(), since die() is what should
be run on the killed CPU, and kill() on the killing CPU?
