Sounds reasonable, I'll try to get to this at some point soon.

BTW, it might be worth changing U-boot CONFIG_LOADADDR to point to the 
value you define for kernel_addr_r.  That would reinforce to folks who 
aren't using the U-boot scripts that they should use that address for 
loading their kernel.
