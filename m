OK, I see you have a very complex governor coming. But you know,
prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future. :-)

It would be very constructive if you could share the governor together
with the proposed change. It is not fair to introduce a new API for a
non-existing user, don't you agree?

The parameters are a zone specific data right? Why should it be bound to
governor switch? The governor should be able to fetch the zone data when
needed.

Again, if you share the user of the API you are proposing we can work
together to make a better fit between API and users.

For the existing governors, I don't see a need to have the stop and
start callbacks.

You have got to be excited about what you are doing. (L. Lamport)
