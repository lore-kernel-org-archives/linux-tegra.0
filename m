OK. Have you read the Example (c) in the thermal binding document
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal)?

where is the descriptor for lm90?

This is actually not how it is supposed to be described.

What is the above? A virtual device?

I believe the above is not really part of the thermal bindings.

The above is a different binding and different API then of what has been
discussed last year for thermal bindings. I am copying here the existing
example:

#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>

&i2c1 {
	...
	/*
	 * A simple IC with a single temperature sensor.
	 */
	adc: sensor@0x49 {
		...
		#thermal-sensor-cells =3D <0>;
	};
};

ocp {
	...
	/*
	 * A simple IC with a single bandgap temperature sensor.
	 */
	bandgap0: bandgap@0x0000ED00 {
		...
		#thermal-sensor-cells =3D <0>;
	};
};

thermal-zones {
	cpu-thermal: cpu-thermal {
		polling-delay-passive =3D <250>; /* milliseconds */
		polling-delay =3D <1000>; /* milliseconds */

		thermal-sensors =3D <&bandgap0>,	/* cpu */
				  <&adc>;	/* pcb north */

		/* hotspot =3D 100 * bandgap - 120 * adc + 484 */
		coefficients =3D 		<100	-120	484>;

		trips {
			...
		};

		cooling-maps {
			...
		};
	};
};



The idea is to have a producer-> consumer description, in which the
thermal zone is the consumer and the sensors are the producers (for
temperature at least).

What is the relation between the sensors you have?

Why the above structure cannot cover for your case? Here is what you
would do to describe your case:

/*
 * You did not specify which type of sensors, so I am assuming
 * they are I2C sensors
 */
&i2c1 {
                 lm90: sensor@48 {
 			...
                         #thermal-sensor-cells =3D <1>;
                 };
};

thermal-zones {
	skin-hotspot: skin-hotspot {
		polling-delay-passive =3D <2000>; /* put the right val */
		polling-delay =3D <1000>; /* put the right val */

		thermal-sensors =3D <&lm90 0>,	/* local */
				  <&lm90 1>;	/* remote */

		/* hotspot ?
		 * What is the relation that describes your sensors?
		 * coefficients =3D  <A_0	A_1>; you have to fill the coef.
		 */

		trips {
			...
		};

		cooling-maps {
			...
		};
	};
};

So, the idea is so that you define your sensor nodes and the respective
drivers, in the above example the i2c drivers, will probe them. When
creating thermal zones, you have to specify the list of sensors by
linking using phandles + sensor specifier, as documented in the thermal
binding text.

The above example is odd to me. Why would a driver be registering zones
from DT and from in kernel definition? The usual path is to have either
one or the other. Even if you are migrating your system to DT based
booting, you may have a mix of devices that are probed via DT and others
that are probed via board files, but one single driver probing both, I
think this is unusual.
