that's something the ARCH should select but it has very little value. I
guess there has been some discussions about dropping that and I support
it.

should it ? I don't know... There's no way to select something as
module, but there's no eas\(y\|ier\) way to make sure PHY is enabled
when building EHCI-tegra.

That I really don't like. I think the driver should be selectable and
build in anything architecture. That's the easier way to:

a) build test a driver when applying patches; and
b) make sure drivers won't include <mach/*> or <asm/*>.
