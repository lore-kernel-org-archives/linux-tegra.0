I think that's exactly what Jon and Sameer were proposing, although the
discussion started primarily because of the way it was done.

So basically the idea was to do:

	pm_runtime_enable()
	if (!pm_runtime_enabled())  /* basically !IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM) */
		hda_runtime_resume()

So we're not calling pm_runtime_resume() but rather the driver's
implementation of it. This is to avoid duplicating the code, which under
some circumstances can be fairly long. Duplicating is also error prone
because both instances may not always be in sync.

My understanding is that Takashi had reservations about using this kind
of construct because, well, frankly, it looks a little weird. We'd also
likely want to have a similar construct again in the ->remove() callback
to make sure we properly power off the device when it is no longer
needed. I'm just wondering if perhaps there should be a mechanism in the
core to take care of this, because this is basically something that we'd
need to do for every single driver.

For example, if !CONFIG_PM couldn't the pm_runtime_enable() function be
modified to do the above? This would be somewhat tricky because drivers
usually use SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS to populate the struct dev_pm_ops and
that would result in an empty structure if !CONFIG_PM, but we could
probably work around that by adding a __SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS that would
never be compiled out for this kind of case. Or such drivers could even
manually set .runtime_suspend and .runtime_resume to make sure they're
always populated.

Another way out of this would be to make sure we never run into the case
where runtime PM is disabled. If we always "select PM" on Tegra, then PM
should always be available. But is it guaranteed that runtime PM for the
devices is functional in that case? From a cursory look at the code it
would seem that way.
