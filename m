I thought the whole point of this discussion was that the timeout in the
first code segment above only applies to command submission, whereas
completion of the erase operation itself was determined by polling using
CMD13, which still uses mmc_erase_timeout(). As such, I don't /think/
that "large erases will timeout" here, unless I'm significantly
misunderstanding something?
