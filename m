Hm yes agreed. I should also write the whole story here, maybe this:

The GIC only support high-active interrupts. When using a PMIC with
low-active interrupt, the PMC has to be configured by using the
nvidia,invert-interrupt property in its node.

This fix sets the GIC back to high-active and reverts commit
eca8f98e404934027f84f72882c5e92ffbd9e5f5.

Well, its kind a question where you are coming from. I read the data
sheet/schemata, and saw that its low-active. Then I went to the PMIC
node and checked how that interrupt is configured, and what you see is
HIGH_ACTIVE. You then think you've found the bug and fix it by setting
it to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW. What you don't know is that PMC is in between
and alters the polarity...
