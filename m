Yes.  As I mentioned before, the bL_ prefix is implied only by the fact 
that big.LITTLE was the motivation for creating this code.

Absolutely.

I'd prefer a more concise name though.

This should be called as soon as possible.

The selection of the last man is accomplished using a platform specific 
mechanism.  By the time this has to be done, the CPU is already dead as 
far as the Linux kernel is concerned, and therefore the generic CPU map 
is not reliable.  In the DCSCB case we simply look at the hardware reset 
register being modified to directly determine the last man.  On TC2 (not 
yet posted) we have to keep a local map of online CPUs.

In your case, the selection of the last man would simply be forced on 
CPU0.
