That sounds broken. Normally, shouldn't CS assert before a transaction,
stay asserted during a transaction, then deassert after the transaction?
It shouldn't rise and fall very quickly in between parts of the transaction.

This sounds like something the SPI core should be managing. If a driver
is using the SPI bus to communicate with a device in a way that needs CS
left active while outside a transaction, it shouldn't be possible for
another driver to come along and communicate with another device before
the first transaction is all complete. The bus should be locked.
Allowing anything else could corrupt the protocol that required specific
CS states outside the transaction.
