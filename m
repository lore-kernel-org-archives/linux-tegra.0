I agree. We can move them out and make them common them later if needed.

We're sometimes trying too hard to find proper homes for various new
drivers, which means that we're proliferating the kernel with a lot of
new driver directories that have only one or two drivers in them.

I'd rather collect stuff in drivers/soc, and move it out as needed
later. Especially since we merge drivers/soc through one merge path
(arm-soc) and can keep an eye on it, while the
scatter-drivers-everywhere approach merges through various
maintainers.
