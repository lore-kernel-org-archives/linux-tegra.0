I have not tested calling it unconditionally. Used another driver as
reference and they had that condition (drivers/bus/imx-weim.c), that
driver does not mention why the condition is there. But will test
removing the condition and see what happens.

Will look in to this.

Got it. Will add a proper consumer name.

ACK.

Will remove that.

Ok, I do not really mind it being GPL version 2 or later so will
change the header comment instead if that is ok.
