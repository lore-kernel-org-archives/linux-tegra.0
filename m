The cover letter says it _is_ a GIC-400, just used in a slightly unusual
manner (i.e. not directly connected to CPUs).

The GIC-400 spec only describes "CLK" (which is what I imagine "ape" is.
There isn't an APB clock described, and the manual seems to show GIC-400
directly connected to AXI rather than APB, so that doesn't seem to even
be the usual "apb_pclk".

Is there some wrapper logic around a GIC-400 to giove it an APB
interface? Or am I misudnerstanding the spec?

The clock-names don't seem right to me, as they sound like provide names
or global clock line names rather than consumer-side names ("clk" and
"apb_pclk").

I'm also not certain about the compatible string; if this really is a
GIC-400 then I would at least expect "arm,gic-400" as a fallback.

Thanks,
Mark.
