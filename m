I don't think so.  Documentation/SubmittingPatches states:

---
The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below:

        Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

	(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
	    are public and that a record of the contribution (including 
	    all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) 
	    is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent 
	    with this project or the open source license(s) involved.

My Signed-off-by: is based on paragraphs (a), (b), and (d).

The intention of my statement is to ensure that credit is appropriately 
provided to everyone who I drew significant inspiration or code from, and 
that such credit makes it into the official commits (e.g., is not dropped 
when the patches are applied.)  However, the patch that I sent is 
differs from the patches that I reviewed while preparing it.

Of course, if anyone would like to add Acked-by or Reviewed-by tags, etc., 
or comment if I've misunderstood something technically etc., that's 
definitely welcome.

Yes, I agree it's unwieldy.  It would be nice to find some concise way to 
refer to "the family of NVIDIA SoCs that includes T124 and T132".  Maybe 
tegra124_family_clock_init_pre() might be a better choice...
