Yes, that's exactly what is happening.

PCIe initialization starts in arch/arm/mach-tegra/pci.e
tegra_pcie_init() which calls arch/arm/kernel/bios32.c
pci_common_init(). That function first calls pcibios_init_hw() (in the
same file, more about this later) and then loops over PCI buses, calling
amongst other things pci_bus_assign_resources() then pci_bus_add_devices().

The problem is that ARM's pcibios_init_hw() calls pci_scan_root_bus()
(or a host-driver-specific function which that also calls
pci_scan_root_bus() in Tegra's case) which in turn calls
pci_bus_add_devices() right at the end, before control has returned to
pci_common_init() and hence before pci_bus_assign_resources() has been
called.

If I modify pci_scan_root_bus() and remove the call to
pci_bus_add_devices(), everything works as expected.

So, I guess the question is: Should ARM's pcibios_init_hw() not be
calling pci_scan_root_bus(), or at least presumably the ARM PCI code
needs to do things in a slightly different order?
