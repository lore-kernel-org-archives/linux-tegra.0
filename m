Yes, perhaps. But there is no point in having
#capture-pwm-cells/capture-pwms if you aren't describing the
connection between the fan and the fan controller.

Yes. As you can have different types of fans (3-wire, 4-wire, etc.)
they would have different compatibles and differing properties
associated with them.

Yes, of course. It's the interface between fan controllers and fans
that I'm concerned about.

Well, those sound like properties of a fan (at least the first one),
so they belong in a fan node.

The aspeed fan controller is probably the closest thing we have to a
fan binding. Look at that if you haven't already.
