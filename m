Actually they are a bit on the fence.

The i.MX and thus the designware patch actually fixes wrong behavior,
where all PCI legacy interrupts would be mapped to a single GIC
interrupt, which would leave INT B,C,D nonfunctional on i.MX.

The others only make DT interrupt mapping functional for all drivers, so
they would be useful if you need to remap interrupts across bridges or
something. But apparently nobody had the need to to this on platforms
other than i.MX until now, so those patches only fix a theoretical
issue.

Lucas
