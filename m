The usual recommendation is to just use Linux coding style in shared
files, and possibly add another header that provides the required
definitions. Otherwise you end up with people randomly cleaning up
the file later ;-)

However, if __ABI_PACKED is defined to an empty string, it is different
in some cases.

Also, setting 'NO_GCC_EXTENSIONS' changes the structure layout of
some of the structures, by adding an extra member. If the firmware
has a compiler that is less than 10 years old, I'd suggest using C99
syntax instead, which should avoid those differences and eliminate
all gcc extensions.

Ah, got it.

Yes, only the alignment of the structure itself is changed, not
the contents. The main difference is that accessing 'rate' on
a target machine without unaligned access will use two 32-bit
loads rather than eight 8-bit loads.

Also, embedding this structure in another one is different
(in theory, I don't expect this to actually appear somewhere):

struct example {
	char a;
	struct cmd_clk_set_rate_request b;
};

would currently be 13 bytes long, with the alignment I suggested you
get three bytes of padding after 'a'.
