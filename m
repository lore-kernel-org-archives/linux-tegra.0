I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do. If you want to use
!PM as a way to debug broken PM, how would that help? Presumably if you
disable !PM then the problem would be gone? In other words, in order to
reproduce a PM related issue don't you have to enable PM first?

I'm not aware of an alternate mechanism to force PM to off once built
into the kernel.

There's no reason per se not to support PM. It's just that at the time
we made the decision that we didn't want to. I vaguely remember that we
tried to do the same thing for 32-bit ARM, but at the time we would've
been the only platform to select PM, and that would've meant enabling
PM for all subarchitectures and therefore forcing PM in multi-platform
builds. Today if you build multi-platform kernels, at least Rockchip
will also forcibly enable PM for everyone.

I think you may also have objected at the time for similar reasons. But
this was a long time ago (at least 2 to 3 years I would guess) and much
has changed since then. Power management has gotten a lot better on
Tegra, to the point where we actually need it in order to properly
function. For example, Tegra DRM is not going to work with !PM because
we rely on runtime PM while disabling and enabling display pipelines.
