Yes, we use the GMI`s CS line. It is important that is present because
it is ANDED with address lines and NOT ALE line. Especially since we
run the GMI controller in AD_MUX mode, which means that we use same
pins for address and data and the access happens in two phases, one
address latch phase where CS is not asserted but ALE is, second
read/write phase where CS must be asserted. In this case we need the
GMI`s CS line to determine which phase we are in.

Will give above a test run.

I understand, and thank you for not requiring me to implement such a
infrastructure :)

And thank you for your feedback.
