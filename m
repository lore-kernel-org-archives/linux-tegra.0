Well, we know what the node must be called, so the pinctrl driver could 
search for it by name.

Isn't the simplest solution to just leave it as it is? Nothing's broken 
is it?

For any new SoCs we add, we can certainly switch to a new scheme if we 
want, but we need to catch/implement that early before the base .dtsi 
file is included in its first kernel release.
