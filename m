There is no problem with keeping compatibility for newer kernels with the older binding, 
it just not worth the effort. The real problem is keeping compatibility of older kernels 
with the new binding, the older kernels won't care about the reg-names and will treat GART 
registers as the second registers bank of the Memory Controller. Unfortunately I don't see 
how your suggestion is supposed to help with the problem.
