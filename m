#2 makes little sense IMHO, for a driver which properly implements
hwmon support. The point of the virtual hwmon device created for
thermal zones was to not put an extra burden on thermal driver authors
by asking them to additionally implement the hwmon interface. But the
hwmon interface it richer than the thermal interface in some respects
so native hwmon implementations are preferred when available. Thus I
think your option #3 below is what we want in addition to #1, and we
don't need #2.
