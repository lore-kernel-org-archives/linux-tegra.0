The "-pm" is not a property of the GIC, but of the SoC. So IMHO the compatible
value should be plain "arm,gic-400".

If a device node has "clocks", "interrupts", "power-domains"[*], ...
properties, and the corresponding providers are not yet available, a driver
typically returns -EPROBE_DEFER, and will be retried later by the driver core.

[*] For "power-domains" this is handled by the device core. I.e. .probe()
     won't even be called before the dependency has been fulfilled.

With IRQCHIP_DECLARE(), you don't have the retrying, and probe order (w.r.t.
to other subsystems) is fixed.

But as you said, gic_of_init() could just bail out if it "clocks" and/or
"power-domains" properties are present, but their providers aren't.
Later, the remaining GICs can be initialized from the platform driver.
You just have to make sure no GIC is initialized twice (I believe that's what
was plaguing me last time I tried your series).

That's probably the closest you can get to normal platform_driver
behavior, without converting the whole GIC driver to a normal platform_driver,
which may cause problems on platforms that are currently working fine.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
