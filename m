I think it's good you raised the question.

I hadn't realized that we have a per-bus iommu_ops pointer. I agree
this will become a limitation as soon as we have a soc with two different
IOMMUs that have platform devices attached, and it has to be moved into
the device or a structure related to that.

If that turns out controversial, we can probably have a set of pseudo
iommu ops that just call into dev->archdata->iommu_ops->function()
for ARM.

Supporting multiple iommus that share one iommu driver should work
without such hacks, as you can put the per-device information into
dev->device_dma_parameters (this works only for very simple IOMMUs)
or dev->archdata->iommu (we may want to generalize that, I think
someone just posted patches for it).

We have just introduced a way to parse dma-ranges in of_dma_configure().

The only way I see this done for platform devices is to do the IOMMU
configuration in the same place: if an iommus property is found there,
we call out to the iommu driver that matches the respective iommu device
and let it configure the master device.

The device already has multiple properties related to iommus:
'struct device_dma_parameters', 'archdata', 'iommu_group', and
pdev_archdata for platform devices. This should be enough to set up
the default iommu dma_map_ops so we can have non-isolated DMA using
dma_map_* and dma_alloc_coherent.

I haven't given much thought to devices that want to use the IOMMU
API directly so they can have multiple domains rather than rely on
the dma-mapping abstraction.
