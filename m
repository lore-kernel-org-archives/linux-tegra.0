It's very common to want to get the display up before the
rest of the system.  So wanting to accelerate one part of the boot
at the expense to the rest of the system is a valid use case.
Deferred initcalls, which is out of tree primarily because it requires
the type of manual tweaking that Tomeu describes, specifically
addressed this issue.

Well, I have probe order problems unrelated to boot time, that
I solved by resorting to putting stuff into modules and loading
them post-boot.  So I'd be interested in easy solutions to managing
boot order in mainline.

I've been worried about DT overhead adding to boot time for a while.
And IMHO probe deferral is just about the lamest way to solve boot
order dependencies I can imagine, from a computer science perspective.
(Well, there's a certain elegance to it, but it's a stupid "make
everything re-doable, back up and start over, time-wasting" elegance.)

However, when Android takes 35 seconds to boot, and most people almost never
cold-boot your product, a few seconds of kernel time-wasting on
cold-boot seem less important. Alas, when I started working on mobile
phones I stopped caring much about boot time.

Thus, I've never worried about the DT overhead enough to actually
measure it, as requested by Greg.  So I'll just shut up now. :-)
