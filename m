Looks good. Just a couple of nits mentioned below, then,

Note: There are a few minor diffs between this file and
spi-tegra20-slink.c. It might be worth eliminating as many as possible,
perhaps in a followon patch.

The binding should specify that a clock named "spi" needs to be
provided, using the standard properties in ../clock/clock-bindings.txt

While Tegra114 is newer, it should really be listed before the Tegra20
entries, since the Makefile is alpha-numerically sorted right now I believe.

No need to use of_match_ptr() there; just use the raw value since
CONFIG_OF is guaranteed to be enabled.
