The other HW in the system expects the I2C slave device to exist. I=20
believe that makes it a HW level description, and hence suitable to=20
represent in DT.

Representing this in DT saves user-space from requiring board-specific=20
knowledge. The kernel should be abstracting HW as best it can, so that=20
user-space can be entirely generic, supporting classes of devices, not=20
enumeration/instantiation of devices. Assuming a system didn't store it=
s=20
root filesystem on a particular SD card or USB controller, we could=20
instantiate those controllers from user-space too (or an initrd even if=
=20
the root fs was there). However, we choose not to do that...

In the specific case of nvec (the I2C slave device that triggered this=20
thread) and I dare say other devices too, there is more to the device=20
than just the I2C slave device. There's also a GPIO that serves to=20
provide synchronization between the SoC and external device.

The primary purpose of nvec is to provide keyboard and mouse (touchpad)=
=20
input, so enabling this once user space was booted would probably work.=
=20
However, the device should likely be enabled by the initrd not the root=
=20
filesystem (if such a split exists in a given distro) so that the user=20
can actually interact with any initrd shell if the boot fails. That=20
would bloat the initrd. System power management (power off at least)=20
goes through the same device, so deferring that might not be great, but=
=20
I suppose there likely wouldn't be a "turn power off" event requested=20
until user-space was booted.
