It's actually a very common argument and I've seen patches in the past
that add includes just for the purpose of making sure the right
definitions get pulled in. This happens quite frequently as a preamble
to some major rework of some header files that would otherwise cause a
lot of breakage.

So I think it's best to be proactive about this and make sure we
explicitly pull in all the necessary headers in the first place,
irrespective of whether or not they may already get pulled in indirectly
by some other headers.
