Indeed. Is that possible with your binding, or would we just duplicate the
IDs between the masters?

If you're doing device passthrough and you want to allow the guest to
program the IOMMU, I think that virtualisation is directly related to the
hardware description, since the guest will be bound by physical properties
of the system.
