Sending these via Arnd's next/dt sounds good to me.  I know we'd usually
take changes that require an atomic update through the same tree, but
Stephen said in https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/30/352 :

   I don't think there's actually any need for that; initializing
   Tegra's SDHCI from device-tree has never worked in mainline to date;
   it relies on patch 1 being there. And if patch 2 was there without
   patch 3, the worst that will happen is some port runs in 4-bit mode
   instead of 8-bit, which evidently works fine since I didn't even
   notice 8-bit support was missing...

Thanks,

- Chris.
