Okay, I understand. However, from a kernel point of view there's no
difference between the TCU and any physical UART. Once the data is
handed to the TCU TX mailbox, it's out of control of the TCU driver.
Whether there's a real UART behind that or some remote processor that
reads the data isn't really relevant.

I certainly approve of that stance.

However, I'd like to reiterate that the TCU design does in fact support
"another way". If you look at the mailbox driver implementation (in the
drivers/mailbox/tegra-hsp.c driver), you'll see that it does support an
interrupt driven mode. After you had reviewed Mikko's earliest proposal
that was indeed implementing busy looping exclusively we both set out
to properly implement interrupt support. This took quite a while to do
because of some gaps in the documentation, but we eventually got it to
work properly. And then it was discovered that it was all a waste of
effort because the console driver couldn't make use of it anyway. Well,
I should say "waste of effort" because I'm still happy that the proper
implementation exists and we can use it under the right circumstances.

So, at least in this particular case, it is not the hardware or firmware
design that's flawed or was taking any shortcuts. It's really just the
particular use-case of the console that doesn't allow us to make use of
the right implementation, which is why we have to resort to the inferior
method of busy-looping.

Great, thanks!
