Hi Bjorn, use devm_request_resource() for host bridge resource is cool,
what about do the similar change for x86, now we request host bridge re=
source
in pci_acpi_root_add_resources() in x86, and we would release the host =
bridge
resource when host bridge device refcount reach 0. This logic may intro=
duce issue,
E.g.
If we try to remove a pci host bridge, but there is a child pci device =
which refcount
cannot decrease to 0 after remove the device, in this case, its parent =
pci_bus and
parent device, all their refcount cannot reach to 0, the result is pci =
host bridge
refcount can not reach 0, so its .release_fn() won't be called, and hos=
t bridge
resouces can not release. If we want to add the pci host bridge again, =
all pci devices
can not work because the resource is conflict with the old.

devm resource would be released when the driver detach, this is better =
than what we do now, I think.

Thanks!
Yijing.
