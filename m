So the supported power-domains per SoC are described in the header
"include/dt-bindings/power/tegra-powergate.h" (see patch #8). Perhaps, I
can move patch #8 to before this patch and add a reference to the header
file for a list of supported power-domains. However ...

... if we eliminate the "reg" property and just use the name, then yes
it would make sense to move the list of support power-domains into the
binding doc.

It all depends on whether we want to define the IDs in the binding or in
the PMC driver. Right now we have a static list of power-domains in the
PMC driver per SoC and I had thought that in the long term we would be
able to get rid of these and just rely on the binding. But ...

 ... that would mean that we have to rely on the binding being correct
and inspect manually. On the other hand, if we don't have the IDs in the
binding we still need to inspect the static arrays in the PMC driver and
so far I have found a few errors with these. So does it really
change/improve anything?
