I would like to believe that the Trusted Foundations monitor had the
same ABI irrespective of which Soc it was running on. However, I have
absolutely no idea at all if that's true. Even if there's some common
subset of the ABI that is identical across all SoCs, I wouldn't be too
surprised if there were custom extensions for each different SoC, or
just perhaps even each product.

Can you research this and find out the answer?

What we can always do is make a compatible property that lists
everything[1], and have the driver match on the most specific value for
now, but relax the driver's matching later if it turns out that the ABI
is indeed common.

[1] That'd need to be at least secure OS name, and secure OS version.
Perhaps the SoC and board data can be deduced from the DT's top-level
compatible properties; nvidia,tegra114-shield, nvidia,tegra114?
