U-Boot appears able to identify the flash chip on my board:

SF: Detected AT25DF321A with page size 256, total 4 MiB

So I guess I have the rework.

Presumably that simply requires changing from:

              flash@0 {
                      reg = <0>;

to:

              flash@1 {
                      reg = <1>;

Aha, indeed that does appear to solve the issue; I can see the U-Boot
environment block when I run "hexdump -C /dev/mtd0" now.

I had forgotten about this from when I tested the older SPI driver that
we ripped out; I had at least compared the registers between U-Boot and
the kernel with that driver, so I'm pretty sure I didn't make that
mistake with the old driver.

So, I'll apply your patch series, and send one to add the flash device
to the Cardhu .dts.
