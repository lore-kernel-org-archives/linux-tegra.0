This all looks very reasonable to me, just a few comments.

For the delay, I think milliseconds is reasonable. I suppose there is
no reasonable need for microseconds?

Is there a reason not to put the phandle here, like:

                                   id = <&mydevice_reg>;

(or maybe 'device' instead of id?)

For the regulator and gpio types I think you only have an enable. For
the pwm, what is the intended binding? Is that documented elsewhere?

Also it might be worth mentioning how you get a struct power_seq from
an fdt node, and perhaps given an example of a device which has an
attached node, so we can see how it is referenced from the device
(of_parse_power_seq I think). Do put the sequence inside the device
node or reference it with a phandle?

Finally, should you use typedefs?
