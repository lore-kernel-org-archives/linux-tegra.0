Ah, so there's some manufacturing calibration process that sets some
fuse value, and the HW uses a combination of that fuse value, and some
parameters of the manufacturing process as represented by the
SENSOR_CONFIG2 register, to apply the calibration? I wonder why
SENSOR_CONFIG2 is a register not a fuse in that case, but anyway...

Perhaps some comments or kerneldoc in the definition of struct
tegra_tsensor would be useful?

I did notice some inconsistency in bracketing at:

Why not read THERMCTL_INTR_STATUS inside the IRQ thread. IIRC, if the
ISR wakes an IRQ thread, the interrupt remains disable until the thread
has run its course, so there's no issue deferring the register read
until the thread runs, at which point, the thread can simply loop over
all the sensors.
