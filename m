I don't actually know what the HW capabilities are. You had best track 
down one of NVIDIA's HW designers/integrators; hopefully the can provide 
all kinds of gory details.

One thing I will say: in U-Boot, we deliberately clip usable RAM size to 
2GiB so that the PA of all RAM fits into 32 bits, specifically because 
of IO controllers that can only address 32 bits. It is possible this was 
only required on earlier chips and T210 fixed it though; I don't know. 
Equally, I suppose the restriction might only apply to a subset of IO 
controllers (USB would be another one relevant to U-Boot).
