Any more thoughts on this?

I have been discussing with Thierry and we think that selecting PM for
tegra still makes the most sense. The question is, is this ok for
multi-configs?

The only other suggestion/thought I have is to allow
PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF to be selected independently of PM so that we can
have minimal support for PM domains that allows you to register PM
domains with the kernel and their current state, but does not allow you
to control them, etc. This way tegra could always select
PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS_OF regardless of PM, and we would be able to
determine if we can probe a device safely.

I am not sure that Rafael is too keen on this approach but that is the
only alternative I have come up with.

I have a rough outline of a patch for this here [0] FWIW.

Cheers
Jon
