I'm not sure how I can be clearer here...  you're replacing something
that is currently pure data with open coding in each device.  That seems
like a step back in terms of ease of use.

Right, but the way it does this is by moving code out of the core into
the drivers - currently drivers just tell the core what resources to
look up and the core then makes sure that they're all present.

Yes, that is another part of issue with this approach - drivers now have
to specify things twice, once for this new interface and once for
actually looking things up.  That doesn't seem awesome and adding the
code into the individual drivers and then having to pull it out again
when the redundancy is removed is going to be an enormous amount of
churn.

Part of what I'm saying here is that in ASoC we already have (at least
as far as the individual drivers are concerned) a declarative way of
specifying dependencies.  This new code should be able to make use of
that, if it can't and especially if none of the code can be shared
between drivers then that seems like the interface needs another spin.

I've not seen this devm_probe() code but the name sounds worryingly like
it might be fixing the wrong problem :/
