Ok, I see. So specifying both SWGROUP and ID in DT would let you do
that, but you don't think anybody ever wants it.

I'm not too worried about the size. My concern is mainly the fact that
you have to add a new file for each new SoC, which is not necessary if
we can find a way to make the binding generic enough to cover any variant.

It's less of an issue for the particular implementation from NVIDIA,
since you have a relatively low number of SoC designs coming out,
compared to some of the other vendors, and in particular compared to
the ARM SMMU that will be shared across many vendors. I definitely
would not want to see per-SoC files for each chip that contains an
ARM SMMU, and I also would like to see IOMMU drivers in general being
implemented in a similar fashion, and your driver sets an example that
others should better not copy IMHO ;-)

I see.

Couldn't you print the DT path of the DMA master to provide the
same information?

So what does "lacency allowance" actually mean, and why do you need to
access this field from Linux? I'm not too familiar with memory controller
concepts, so I'm sorry if this is an RTFM question.

Hmm, where are they actually needed both at the same time then? IOW,
why can't the IOMMU driver just deal with the SWGROUP and ignore the
table with the ID and LA values, leaving that to the memory controller
driver?
