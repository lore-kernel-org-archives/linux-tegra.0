Yeah, thanks Alex. :)

So this is a non power sequence version of backlight & panel enabling,
isn't it? I remember we talked about this several days ago and you
mentioned kernel guys want an ad-hoc version(power sequence logics
inside driver, not in DT) and I believe this is it, right?

I think finally I can enable Tegra30 cardhu's display after this patch
merged.
