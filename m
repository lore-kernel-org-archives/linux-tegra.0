Sure; s/either/both/ in what I said.

If someone implements the same thing in some downstream/product kernel, 
and it can't be upstreamed, I'd argue they should still do that in the 
clock core rather than individual clock drivers, since they'll probably 
want the feature for multiple clocks. I don't think  the per-clock 
debugfs hook is useful in this case, although I can certainly imagine 
other read-only per-clock debug files could be useful.
