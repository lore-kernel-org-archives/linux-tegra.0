My particular setup may be much simpler than the average PowerPC machine. T=
he
patchset is only what I need to get PCIe running on the platform, which has
an FPGA connected to the Tegra via PCIe. For instance there is no legacy
interrupt support (only MSI), so interrupt remapping is not required. I also
know that OF nodes are not properly hooked up with the PCI devices yet, whi=
ch
I will need, among other things, to provide platform data for an SPI flash
connected to an SPI master implemented within the FPGA. I also haven't look=
ed
at specifying the memory ranges via the device tree.

So quite a lot may still be missing, but does that prevent any of this from
being added to mainline? Things can be added on an as-needed basis, can't
they?
