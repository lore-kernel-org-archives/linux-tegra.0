So I guess this introduces a problem not uncommon to other types of
resources. If you remove the driver, even if you fail ->remove() the
module may still go away along with any code associated with it. So
even if the PM domains can't be removed, you can't prevent the module
=66rom going away. That could be somewhat mitigated if we were holding a
module reference count, because then the only way to unload the driver
would be via sysfs (we could prevent that too, which might be the best
way to do this today).

There is work underway to solve this generically, Rafael was working on
this, so I'm not sure we need to add additional infrastructure to the PM
domain code as part of this series. But we may want to mark the Tegra
PMC driver as .suppress_bind_attrs =3D true, to make sure it can't be
removed.

Would it be worth noting here that the object is only removed from the
list of domains, but that users are still responsible for freeing any
resources (such as memory) associated with it? It seems like this might
be obvious enough given the usage model of pm_genpd_init(), but it's
something that I noticed missing from the function.

Otherwise this looks fine:
