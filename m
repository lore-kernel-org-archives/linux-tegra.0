Oh I've misread this step for the fb_helper->funcs assignment. Makes sense
and I don't think we need to augment your kerneldoc more to explain this.

Hm, maybe clarify this as "initialize modeset objects like crtcs, encoders
and connectors"? Since that's the important part we need to get done here.

I've more meant that after this it's save for drivers to enable hpd
interrupts and start to process them. I.e.

	- enable interrupts and start processing hpd events

as an additional step to make it really cleear how it all fits together.
Otherwise driver authors are left wondering wtf this isn't just one
function call to do it all for them ;-)

If it looks ugly I'm ok as-is, just wondered. Kerneldoc is a bit
simplistic ime.
