My main thought was for modules we will almost always have devices
appearing first. More generally, we can have devices and drivers
coming or going at any point in time and should not put restrictions
on ordering.

Also, I think all the probe ordering and dependency tracking should be
done within the driver core (i.e. dependencies are a list of struct
devices). At some level it has to become firmware specific, but we
want to minimize that part. I could be convinced otherwise and you
have put more thought into this problem than I have.

That shouldn't matter as PNP matching is PNP specific. We already have
different ways of matching with device/driver name or of_match_table
for example. Changing how and when OF matching occurs would not affect
PNP matching. We do matching on device and driver add currently. For
the "when" part, we would need to add what I'll call async matching or
deferred matching which in addition to matching on the of_match_table
also matches on the dependency list having probed. Your last series
essentially does this, but the difference is yours is not OF specific
and I think it needs to be. I mean it is OF specific only in the
aspect that matching already is. From a driver and subsystem
standpoint, it should not be OF specific much like deferred probe is
not OF specific, but in reality only occurs (currently) on OF probed
drivers.

I'd imagine Kevin would be happy to. That is still a subset of h/w, so
we'd need a way to disable any solution.
