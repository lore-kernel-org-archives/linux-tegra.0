Thanks Stephen for review.
I have taken care of almost all feedback. Some of having my below comments.

We do write register very less (as we  shadow the register locally), I 
do not see any perf degradation here.

Status gets updated together. There is no steps of updating status.

I saw the issue by my checkpatch is not caching the issue. Let me 
recheck my command.

I will post the change for moving the code to core later. I will keep 
this for now.

I think it is possible by checking some flags, I will explore and will 
post the fix later.

OK, I move the clock control in runtime callbacks.

In this case, we can get rid of isr thread and move the wait/status 
check to caller thread.
I need to do some more stress on this and if it is fine then will post 
the patch later for this, not as part of this patch.

Is there a way to support the reset of controller. We will need this 
functionality.
