These are standard pinctrl properties. While not relevant to the OS and
driver agnostic bindings documentation, the way Linux pinctrl works
would make omitting either of those properties tricky to implement in a
pinctrl provider driver. As far as I can tell, the power state should
be stated explicitly if it's modified in any of the pin configurations.

At least in the case of SDMMC, the pad is powered from an external
adjustable regulator, however the pad must be configured to a voltage
matching the voltage that is supplied to the pad from the regulator. The
TRM does not go into much detail on the actual mechanisms behind this.
I wanted to avoid introcuding new vendor specific properties and just
stick with the standard pinctrl ones.

The power state isn't modified. By default the pads are powered.

PMC pad configuration of this sort was introduced in Tegra124.
