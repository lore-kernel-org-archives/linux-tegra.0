Ah, I see. Can we add the extra move to make sure the register is always
initialized now even though the path won't be used. That way, nobody
will be confused by this.

OK, if the function gets larger with more shared, I guess it's fine.
Right now, the conditional-to-non-conditional code ratio is pretty high.
