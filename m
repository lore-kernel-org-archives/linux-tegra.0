Unfortunately, this patch doesn't seem to solve the problem for me. I
still get a hang/crash very early during boot, before earlyprintk stars.

I tried this patch on top of both next-20150115, and next-20150516. For
both those kernels, reverting the original problematic patch does
resolve the problem.

I'll try to investigate more later today.
