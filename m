Bringing DT into the bootloader was one the single most important
things for productivity we ever did.
On i.MX (the best supported arch in Barebox) it has brought down bringup
time for boards already supported by Linux to a few hours and enables us
to share effort spent for bootloader development on new boards with
later Linux development. Writing a single DT description for the
hardware to bring up the bootloader greatly reduces the time needed to
bring up Linux later on.

I could do that, but...

Just because the DTS are still located in the kernel tree doesn't mean
the kernel is the only user. DT is meant to be a hardware description.
IMHO knowing that the kernel isn't using some information contained in
there is no argument for omitting the info.
