I've another variant. What about to drop the GART registers from the
binding? The range is always fixed and there is no good reason to
artificially change it. I recall that in the past you didn't like the
patch that made the GART's aperture size fixed, saying that some
imaginary person may want to change it via DT. It's still not a very
good argument to me, I can't see a good reason why anyone may want to
change the aperture size.

The new binding will look like this (just like T30+ binding, only
iommu-cells number differ):

     memory-controller@7000f000 {
         compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-mc";
         reg = <0x7000f000 0x00000400>;
         clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_MC>;
         clock-names = "mc";

         interrupts = <GIC_SPI 77 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

         #reset-cells = <1>;
         #iommu-cells = <0>;
     };

That way older kernel will continue to work with the new binding because
of the miss of the second registers range and new kernels may keep
supporting the old binding. Though I don't think that keeping support of
the old binding really worth the churning. Thoughts?

Note that new kernels will require the "mc" clock and hence the old
binding will be rejected because it doesn't have that clock.
