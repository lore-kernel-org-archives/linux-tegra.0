Note that .previous has another important gotcha.  Consider:

	__INIT
	/* now in .text.init */
	ALT_UP(...)
	/* now in .text.init */
	__FINIT

	/* now in .alt.smp.text! */


.previous (or macros containing a dangling .previous) shouldn't be used
unless you're absolutely certain what the previous section was.

In general:

	label:
		<stuff>

		.previous

restores to the section which was current at label, only if there are
no section directives in <stuff>, nor anything which could contain a
section directive after macro expansion.

The same goes for the hidden, dangling .previous embedded in __FINIT
and friends.
