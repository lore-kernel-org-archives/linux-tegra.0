ARCH_TEGRA has depended on OF for a very long time, so I don't think we
care about the non-DT case.

Ah yes, of course. You could still do it with just the two pointers if
you keep the code as-is and revert back to the backed up value in case
of errors. Along this line:

	base =3D pmc->base;

	pmc->base =3D devm_ioremap_resource(&pdev->dev, res);

	/* on success */
	iounmap(base);

	/* on error */
	pmc->base =3D base;

These pointer assignments should be atomic, so no potential for races
there. I've attached a patch which should do the trick, though I have
not tested it.

The primary reason for the "takeover" is that except for the extra
iounmap() and pointer swapping the tegra_pmc_probe() function is really
a standard driver implementation. The idea behind this had always been
that it should be possible to easily convert this to a proper driver if
either we ended up with PSCI exclusively for SMP or defer SMP setup
until the PMC driver had been probed, so that we could get rid of the
early_initcall().
