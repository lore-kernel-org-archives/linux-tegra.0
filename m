Hi Daniel,
Thanks for the comments.
Please find below my understanding in this direction.

1. Currently struct videomode is being used in 50 drm drivers and 14 fbdev drivers.
   Since, it's already being used by so many drm drivers, that is the reason 
   these fbdev objects (struct videmode and func drm_display_mode_to_videomode) were used in this patch series.

2. Anyway, if fbdev related objects (struct/func) are not encouraged in drm drivers, then we may add 
   h/v front/back porches in struct drm_display_mode as adviced by you.

3. We can calculate these params in func drm_mode_set_crtcinfo at the end of it.
   int drm_mode_set_crtcinfo ()
   {
   .
   .
   crtc_hfront_porch = crtc_hsync_start - crtc_hdisplay;
   crtc_vfront_porch = crtc_vsync_start - crtc_vdisplay; 
   .
   .
   crtc_clock_hz = crtc_clock*1000;
   };

4. Normally mode is programmed in HW in following callbacks of crtc and encoder drivers
   -mode_set
   -mode_set_nofb
   -atomic_enable

   
   Normally drm_mode_set_crtcinfo is used in
   -mode_fixup callbacks (CBs) 
   of encoder and crtc drivers.

   if mode_fixup CBs are called before mode_set CBs then
   drm_mode_set_crtcinfo is right place to calculate sync/porch params. 
   We can use crtc_hfront/back_porches directly and program them to HW
   in above mentioned callbacks.
   
   int my_mode_set () 
   {
   	REG_WRITE(crtc_hfront_porch);
        REG_WRITE(crtc_hback_porch);
        .
        .
   } 	

 6.  However, if these params are being modified after calling drm_set_crtcinfo as mentioned below:

   bool amdgpu_atombios_encoder_mode_fixup(struct drm_encoder *encoder,
				 const struct drm_display_mode *mode,
				 struct drm_display_mode *adjusted_mode)
   {
	struct amdgpu_encoder *amdgpu_encoder = to_amdgpu_encoder(encoder);

	/* set the active encoder to connector routing */
	amdgpu_encoder_set_active_device(encoder);
	***drm_mode_set_crtcinfo(adjusted_mode, 0);****

	/* hw bug */
	if ((mode->flags & DRM_MODE_FLAG_INTERLACE)
	    && (mode->crtc_vsync_start < (mode->crtc_vdisplay + 2)))
		adjusted_mode->crtc_vsync_start = adjusted_mode->crtc_vdisplay + 2;

  Then we may need to define new func like

  void drm_calc_hv_porches_sync()
  {
   crtc_hfront_porch = crtc_hsync_start - crtc_hdisplay;
   crtc_vfront_porch = crtc_vsync_start - crtc_vdisplay; 
   .
   . 
   crtc_clock_hz = crtc_clock*1000;
  }  and call this func in mode_set*, atomic_enable CBS before programming the HW with this mode.

  
  Should I create patches around this idea ?
  Please let me know your comments. 


Thanks
