... and making that elided "setup whatever mappings it wants" step more 
efficient is the sole thing that this patch set is trying to address. I 
apologise for not really following what you're getting at here.

Eh, swings and roundabouts. An argument denoting whether the flush is 
being called on the map or unmap path would be fine, it just means some 
implementations will be doing an extra no-op function call half the 
time. On closer inspection, the code in patch 3 _is_ using a table walk 
to figure out if the IOVA has been mapped or unmapped, it just happens 
that this particular implementation needs to do that walk anyway to sync 
the PTE updates, so gets away with it.

Robin.
