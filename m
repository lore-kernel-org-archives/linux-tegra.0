No, because I know what you meant before:-)

The thing I was missing is that the existing disp1/disp2 naming is
/only/ something that's in the DT. The driver (and hence the exiting
as-yet-undocumented ABI) looks up this clock as "index 0" not as "name
disp1". Hence, we /can/ change the documented name without affecting
the ABI at all, and not affecting the ABI is something I was trying to
avoid in this patch.

So, how about I fold the following into this patch:
