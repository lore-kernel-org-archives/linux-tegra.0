No, we're not adding this to the core.

While in principle you could provide a set of pointers to the routines
you want to be called when CONFIG_PM is unset, IMO it is just cleaner
and more straightforward (and fewer lines of code for that matter) to add
a simple conditional to each ->probe() and ->remove().

This IMO is an excellent point.

Trying to handle the !CONFIG_PM case only really makes sense if you know
what to do to turn the device on without relying on things like PM domains
etc which are not even available if CONFIG_PM is not set.

IOW, if any of the platforms your driver is expected to work with require
something like genpd to even make the device functional, I wouldn't bother.

Thanks,
