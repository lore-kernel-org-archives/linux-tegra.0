I don't think that implementing it one way and then changing to a
different way will benefit history at all. It'll make the history more
complicated. What exactly is the problem with just using coupled cpuidle
from the start? If we did merge this implementation now, then switch to
coupled cpuidle later, when do you think the switch would happen?

CPUquiet isn't relevant at all. First, a user may presumably disable
CPUquiet's Kconfig option (it had better have one, and the system had
better work with it disabled). Second, even if CPUquiet is enabled, I
don't imagine there is a 100% guarantee that hot(un)plug will happen
before cpuidle kicks in, is there? Finally, is there any guarantee that
CPUquiet will actually be accepted upstream?
