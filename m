I see the reason behind your patch. Somehow, I don't like that host
drivers need to care about such things for specific commands.

The host driver should only tell it's maximum supported busy detection
timeout (max_discard_to) to the core layer, which should be needed
only of it supports MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY.

Then the core layer should decide what to do depending on current
needed timeout.

BTW, do you know why sdhci haven't enabled MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY. It
seems like it should be?

Agree!
