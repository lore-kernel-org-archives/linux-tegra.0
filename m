An abstraction to access iommu is preferable since Tegra2 and Tegra3 are 
quite a bit different when it comes to iommu.

But so far I'm pretty pleased with the driver Thierry has done. I'm 
hoping we can start using this as a base instead of the fb based driver 
that never made it upstream. (even if I have had a bit of a debate about 
GEM v. TTM v. ION v. ...)
