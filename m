There are several other drivers doing that already, eg:

drivers/misc/eeprom/eeprom_93cx6.c
drivers/misc/atmel-ssc.c
drivers/misc/atmel_pwm.c

Tegra has always avoided using the init calls and from previous versions of
this patchset it's clear changing the init order is not an option for
backwards compatibility reasons.

Given that it seems to be impossible to reach consensus on what the exact
behaviour should be, consider this patchset to be abandoned.
