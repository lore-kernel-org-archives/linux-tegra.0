On the device I was testing on (qemu's vexpress-a15 machine) the
machine booted and I was able to open a ssh session, but serial was
broken among other AMBA devices:

/memory-controller@2b0a0000
/memory-controller@7ffd0000
/dma@7ffb0000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/sysctl@020000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/aaci@040000

/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/uart@0c0000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/wdt@0f0000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/timer@110000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/timer@120000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/rtc@170000
/smb/motherboard/iofpga@3,00000000/clcd@1f0000

Another way of avoiding this particular problem would be not delaying
the probe of devices in the configuration bus, by doing something like
this:

diff --git a/drivers/bus/vexpress-config.c b/drivers/bus/vexpress-confi=
g.c
index 6575c0fe6a4e..eda293869cd3 100644
--- a/drivers/bus/vexpress-config.c
+++ b/drivers/bus/vexpress-config.c
@@ -181,7 +181,7 @@ static int vexpress_config_populate(struct
device_node *node)
        if (WARN_ON(!parent))
                return -ENODEV;

-       return of_platform_populate(node, NULL, NULL, parent);
+       return of_platform_populate_early(node, NULL, NULL, parent);
 }

 static int __init vexpress_config_init(void)

But I think this would be papering over the underlying issue and it
would be better to have proper explicit dependencies.
