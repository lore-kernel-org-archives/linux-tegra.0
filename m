Sure, some of those variable may differ based on the SoC at runtime etc.

But at least the value of iram_code never changes, right?

OK, I see this is enhanced immediately in the next patch, so it's fine.

Sure. However, if the AVP never touched the IRAM region where the LP1
resume code is placed, we would only need to copy the LP1 resume code to
IRAM once at kernel boot time, rather than every time we enter/leave LP1.

I guess the idea is that once we have an AVP driver, we will force the
AVP to suspend first, save the IRAM that it might have been using, do
the system suspend/resume, then restore the IRAM. And that changing that
sequence so that the AVP never ever touched the LP1 IRAM area would
require AVP firmware changes that we can't make?
