Ok, this is a mess, don't send me patches that need to be applied in a
specific order, yet are not obviously linked together in a single
series.

How do you expect a maintainer to handle this type of stuff?  You need
to make it _OBVIOUS_ as to what I need to do here, otherwise I will get
it wrong.

I'm going to drop all of your patches from my queue and wait for a
resend with the correct order, and ones that work properly, you can do
better than this :)

thanks,
