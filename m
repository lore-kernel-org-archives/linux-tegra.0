Mesa support aside- if I start a computationally intensive job on the
Jetson TX2 like building the Linux kernel on all cores, it will lock
up. My only work around has been to disable the Denver CPU's. I don't
think the tegra186 has upstream support to control the fan on the
Jetson TX2, could this be a thermal problem?
