I think in the header file you could just write

extern ..... power_seq_delay_type;
#ifndef ...
#define power_seq_delay_type NULL
#endif

And then, in the .c file:

static const struct power_seq_res_ops power_seq_ops[POWER_SEQ_NUM_TYPES] = {
	[POWER_SEQ_DELAY] = power_seq_delay_type,
	...
};

And then you can stop including the .c files directly, and link them
instead.

It's not a rule, although there is a small passage about it in CodingStyle
file when it describes commenting style. Though, some folks choose to
ignore this suggestion quite frequently, especially if variables have no
comments.

Often, the multiple declarations per line are used to hide ugly functions
w/ tons of variables, or just to confuse the reader for the fun of it.

There are exceptions, of course. E.g.

	int i, j, k; /* Our iterators. */

Is perfectly fine.

But
	int i, err;

At least to me seems weird, this stuff is logically disjunct.

Only human can truly differentiate when the stuff "looks better" together
or apart, so that's why checkpatch doesn't complain. Personally, I use
this rule of thumb: when in doubt, use just one declaration per line, it
is always OK. :)

Thanks,
Anton.
