Ok. If we have such a mechanism, that works too ofcourse. I was under the
impression there is no way to know if you're running in secure mode
or non-secure mode.

Ok. That should be good enough indeed.

Sure. But it would be nice if we can support existing systems which have a
secure OS we can't change.

GP OMAP devices provide this, but then again they aren't meant to be secure
even though they run linx in non-secure mode...
