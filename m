Well, one of the nice things here is that everything to conctrol the HW
is in the driver, unlike on other systems without all this data that
have to rely on opaque BIOS/ACPI/EFI/... hooks.

Perhaps what we need is a way to build all these drivers as modules, but
still link them into the kernel so they're statically available during
early boot, but allow them to be unloaded like modules after the system
has booted and determined they aren't needed.

This would have the advantage of getting rid of the unused driver code
as well, whereas putting the data into DT only handles ensuring the data
for other SoCs isn't present in the kernel after boot.
