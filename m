The other alternative is for you to maintain this going forward; I
believe that would be as simple as:

* Create a patch to add yourself to MAINTAINERS for the
drivers/power/power_seq/ directory.

* Get a kernel.org account, push this patch to a branch there, and add
the branch into linux-next.

* Send a pull request to Linus at the appropriate time.

* Ongoing: Accept any patches, perform any maintenance required, etc.

Does anyone see any issue with Alexandre doing this? Nobody else has
volunteered yet:-)
