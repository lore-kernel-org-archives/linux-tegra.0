I was trying to raise the issue and apparently I succeeded. For now,
I put in place yet-another-temporary-solution to the problem in one
of the drivers I need for power management, but certainly the problem is
not solved, and I can't allocate time to do it myself unfortunately.

I am more than happy to review patches though.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
