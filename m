Once a cpu has incremented the counter, it has no way out unless either
1: another cpu (that hasn't incremented the counter yet) receives an
interrupt, aborts idle, and clears its idle flag
or
2: all cpus enter the ready counter, and call the cpuidle driver's
enter function.

In your example, cpu 1 has incremented the counter, so it cannot be on
the way out unless cpu 0 aborts (in which case it will not increment
the counter, and the counter will never be equal to the number of
cpus), or unless cpu 0 turns off its interrupts and incrementes the
counter (in which case neither cpu can return until after the cpuidle
driver's enter function has been called on all cpus).
