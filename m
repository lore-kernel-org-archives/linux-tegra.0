Sure. I was hoping you'd try it out since you already had the setup to 
repro the issue.

It'd be good if your test-bed used the built-in U-Boot variables too, so 
we're testing them.

I expect the issue is more how close the uncompressed kernel and/or DTB 
are to the start of RAM (where the decompressor writes to). IIRC, if the 
decompressor is going to overwrite the compressed kernel during 
decompression, it moves itself first. I can't remember where the 
destination of the move is, but perhaps the relocation can over-write 
the DTB. By pushing the location of the compressed kernel away from the 
start of RAM, this relocation won't happen. IIRC when the decompression 
happens, or relocation prior to decompression, there's no protection of 
the DTB being overwritten.
