As you said in the response you linked to, the objection is invalid 
since it won't break any DTs. The driver for a node is responsible for 
defining the meaning of its own reg properties. It should be pretty 
trivial to allow the Tegra I2C controller driver (or indeed any driver 
at all) to handle either #address-cells=<1> (the current setting) or 
#address-cells=<2> (a new value which enables adding a new flag cell) or 
even #address-cells=<1> with some of the upper bits of the reg value 
used as flags (which would default to 0 in all current DTs, so e.g. 
using the MSB==1 as a slave flag), all at run-time with complete 
backwards-compatibility.
