That's not a valid value; it just means that the GIC driver doesn't
explicitly set the type, and the HW probably defaults to active high?

Comments no, I just have confusion!

We should simply set this flag to the correct value. Does the PMIC
output an edge-sensitive or level-sensitive signal? Is the signal
active-high/rising or active-low/falling? Those are the only things that
should be considered when selecting the correct value for the IRQ flags.
This information can be determined by reading the data sheet for the
PMIC; while the test results you mention above are interesting, the HW
documentation should drive the value we select here, unless the
documentation has a known bug.

If there is an IRQ storm, then that sounds like a bug in the code. That
needs to be fixed too, not worked around by setting an incorrect IRQ
flags value.

To be clear, here is what I would expect depending on what kind of IRQ
signal the PMIC outputs:

active-low:
GIC: active-high, PMC: nvidia,invert-interrupt

active-high:
GIC: active-high, PMC: NO nvidia,invert-interrupt

falling-edge:
GIC: rising-edge-triggered, PMC: nvidia,invert-interrupt

rising-edge:
GIC: rising-edge-triggered, PMC: NO nvidia,invert-interrupt
