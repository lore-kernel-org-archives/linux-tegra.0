Yeah, it's a solution anyway. I'm mostly worried that it means all other co=
de
(especially not in Linux) using the dts will be plagued by this, which seem=
s a
bit unfair. I still see this as an error not being fixed.

Oh, I thought it was still up for review when sending my previous message.

=46rom my perspective, fixing counter-intuitive behaviour justifies that.

But you're probably right to point out that others down the line will most
likely prefer to keep the change you introduced. So I'll put it this way:
if everyone agrees that it's okay to break support for older device-trees,
then I'm available to craft a patch. Otherwise, let's just stick with you
changes you got in.

Frankly I've never understood why kernel maintainers expect this is not the
case, and this is quite frequently a pain when trying to address issues suc=
h as
this one. While I reckon that device-trees shouldn't be tied to the kernel =
in
particular (both are independent), I think it's fair to except that users u=
se
device-trees matching the release date of the kernel.

It's usually accepted that projects have dependencies on certain versions o=
f
libraries and explicitly do not support older versions of these. It would b=
e
nice to adopt the same attitude towards device-tree. These are my 2 cents o=
n the
issue, of course this isn't up for me to decide.

Right. Note that I'll be testing your bq24735 patches on nyans soon, so per=
haps
I'll have an upcoming series in case I spot any regression.

Cheers!
