In practice, fans.

It doesn't provide a PWM output. The (Linux) PWM framework provides 
functionality in both directions - control and capture. But if the 
device tree #pwm-cells/pwms properties are only for control, we may need 
to introduce a new #capture-pwm-cells/capture-pwms or similar.

The idea is that the generic fan node can then specify two pwms, one for 
control and one for capture, to enable e.g. closed-loop control (I'm not 
personally familiar with the usecase for this but I could imagine 
something like that). The control PWM can be something completely 
different, maybe not a PWM in the first place (e.g. some fixed voltage).

I'm not quite getting what you mean by this. Clearly we need a custom 
compatibility string for the tachometer as it's a different hardware 
block with different programming than others. Or are you complaining 
about the nvidia,pulse-per-rev/capture-window-len properties?

Thanks,
