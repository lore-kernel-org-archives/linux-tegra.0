Yes, it's my mistake, will fix it in next series.

Yes, we set this sub nodes as cooling devices.
Let me explain it.
The Tegra's soctherm has the HW throttle function, it will be triggered=
 when the
temperatures reach to the "hot" type trip. These throttle events can be
configured to different levels "heavy" and "light" on different sensors=
=2E So it
something like cooling devices which can be bound with thermal zones, a=
nd in
this way, we can use the linux of-thermal framework to handle it. If no=
t, we
have to add more codes to parse these configuration and set them for th=
ose
sensors. I had used this method to handle the shutdown function in Tegr=
a's
soctherm driver in my previous series, however Rob didn't like it, he p=
referred
to use linux framework to handle it.
So I think it's better to set these throttle-cfgs as cooling devices, s=
o they
can be bound to the cpu/gpu thermal zones easily.

Ok, let me describe it.
When the "heavy" cooling device triggered, the hardware will skip cpu c=
lock's
pulse in HIGH level, and if the "light" triggered, the hardware will sk=
ip cpu
clock's pulse in MED level.
If these two devices are triggered in same time, the HW throttle arbite=
r will
select the highest priority as the final throttle settings to skip cpu =
pulse.
