struct pci_ops has a long history of being specifically about
config space read/write operations, so on the one hand it does
not feel like the right place to put interrupt specific operations,
but on the other hand, the name sounds appropriate and I cannot
think of any other place to put this, so it's fine with me.

The only alternative I can think of is to introduce a new
structure next to it in struct pci_bus, but that feels a bit
pointless. Maybe Bjorn has a preference one way or the other.
