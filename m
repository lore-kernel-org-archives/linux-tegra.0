I'm actually pretty confused by the implementation of the quirk as well,
why do you even need this pcie_find_root_port() function?  Your fixup is
called for every single PCI device in the system, so why do you need to
go to the trouble of scanning the topology for the root port?  You'll be
passed the root port eventually and it will match your ID table w/o any
extra effort.  As coded, you're calling the set capability function
multiple times per root port, once for itself and once for each device
below it.

Personally, I'd probably do away with the table, declare a fixup for
each entry for the specific vendor/device ID, and make a simple quirk
callback that sets the capability bit.  Just my preference though.
Thanks,

Alex
