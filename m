Looking back at that conversation, I'm not convinced by your explanation.

Some questions:

What does the PMIC output for an IRQ signal? It sounds like SW can
select either active-high level, or active-low level. Which of those is
the HW default? Does the Linux kernel driver attempt to program the HW
to select one or the other? If so, how does it determine which option to
choose, and where's the code that does that?

For now, let's not worry about system suspend issues, what the GIC
supports, etc. I only want to know about the PMIC for now.

Once we know the answer to that question, we can correctly configure the DT.
