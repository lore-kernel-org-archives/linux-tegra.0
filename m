nit, we have this doc in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/nvidia,tegra30-smmu.txt.

Probably under Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu, it's easier to
find the similarity among SoC IOMMUs.

Actually the above summarize tegra SMMU situation well too. For
example, each IOMMU'able device has IOVA constraint that some of the
address area isn't available because of its MMIO. This info needs to
be described in DT. If <IOMMU phandle> + some parametes are embedded
in a device node, that info could be dealt at a bus notifier(*1).
