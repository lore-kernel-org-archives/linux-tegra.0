It just occurred to me that none of these options really make much of a
difference. As Jon mentioned once we merge this series a lot of features
on Tegra will start to rely on PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS and hence PM. So if we
do want to build a kernel with a maximum of Tegra features enabled (and
I think a multi_v7_defconfig should include that) we'll end up with a PM
dependency anyway, whether forced via select or implied via depends on.

I'm beginning to wonder if PM really should be an option these days. The
disadvantages of making it optional do outweigh the advantages in my
opinion. I'm not saying that, in general, it's totally useless to build
a kernel that has no PM support, but for the more specific case where
you would want to enable multi-platform support I don't think there's
much practical advantage in allowing !PM. One of the most common build
warnings are triggered because of this option. Also multi-platform
kernels are really big already, so much so that I doubt it would make a
significant difference if we unconditionally built PM support. Also the
chances are that we'll be seeing more and more SoCs support PM and rely
on it, much like Tegra would with the addition of this series.

I imagine that we could save ourselves a lot of headaches by simply
enabling PM by default, whether that be via the PM Kconfig option or by
selecting it from ARCH_TEGRA and any other architectures that may come
to rely on it. Doing so would also reduce the amount of test coverage
that we need to do, both at compile- and runtime.
