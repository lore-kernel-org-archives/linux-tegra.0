Stephen, the "core thermal code" defined two major object types:
  * a thermal zone
  * a cooling device

Each thermal zone corresponds to a physical region in space within a 
device. A sane person might expect there to be one physical temperature 
sensor associated with each zone. But, that's not always the case.

Because the thermal core did not expose the concept of a "sensor" 
separately from a "zone", many drivers which register thermal zones are 
messy -- they include a mix of device driver code (i.e. poking at 
register for a thermal sensor IP block) and device-agnostic code for 
implementing behaviors required of a thermal zone.

of-thermal does more than just parse device tree. It registers thermal 
zones using its own implementation of that device-agnostic code. Having 
that centralized implementation of the thermal zone code allows thermal 
sensor device drivers which talk to of-thermal to be simpler than 
drivers which try to talk directly to the thermal core.

The fact that you need to use DT to make use of the simpler sensor 
driver interface doesn't seem like a good reason to push back on Mikko's 
change.
