I don't really like the idea of having multiple code paths for the same thing.
This is very error prone, and likely to bitrot pretty quickly.

We'll see. We can always tone it down a notch, should it prove to be too noisy...
So far, I haven't seen it firing. On the other hand, I get the following stuff
on my APM board:

[    0.000000] GIC: PPI0 is either secure or misconfigured
[    0.000000] GIC: PPI13 is either secure or misconfigured
[    0.000000] arm_arch_timer: WARNING: Invalid trigger for IRQ1, assuming level low
[    0.000000] arm_arch_timer: WARNING: Please fix your firmware
[    0.000000] arm_arch_timer: WARNING: Invalid trigger for IRQ2, assuming level low
[    0.000000] arm_arch_timer: WARNING: Please fix your firmware

Pretty awesome...
