The IO mapped memory is strongly-ordered on ARM, hence all readl/writel accesses are guaranteed to be ordered by default. I think wmb() here is just a cut-n-pasted relic from old downstream driver.

Yes, the result is the same. The wmb() is not just about IO accesses, but about all kind of memory accesses and at least on Tegra30 it is quite expensive operation because it translates into L2XO cache syncing (arm_heavy_mb) + dsb(). It should be more efficient to flush out writes with a read-back and then wait for that read operation to be completed.
