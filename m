I would have liked to see a smaller pinctrl driver and one with fewer macros,
but I'm not going to complain about it -- drivers/pinctrl is definitely your
turf not mine and I assume that Olof's Ack was meant in his position as Tegra
maintainer instead of his position as arm-soc maintainer.

It's unfortunate that the number of lines in the board specific pinmux
files is actually growing, even though the contents seem to be smaller
and it seems to be done in a way that all the data will move into the
device tree eventually. What is holding up that move right now?
I guess if we could move the per-board pinmux data into dts files,
that would mean we could actually get rid of the per-board source
files in tegra, right?

One thing that worries me a bit is the object size of the tegra
pinctrl driver: There are now about 70kb pinmux driver binary in
each kernel that wants to run on tegra (about the same as the
remaining tegra platform code), which can become a bottleneck
in future multi-platform kernels that also want to run on a lot of
other things. 
Will it be possible to eventually put the pinmux driver into a loadable
module?
