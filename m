I think if the code needs this clock, I'd be tempted to do the following:

clk = clk_get(dev, "disp1");
if (IS_ERR(clk) && PTR_ERR(clk) != -EPROBE_DEFERRED)
    clk = clk_get(dev, "disp2");
if (IS_ERR(clk))
    return PTR_ERR(clk);

That avoids having to hard-code IP block base addresses and construct
clock names at run-time.
