Yeah, my original intention was to avoid flooding userland, specially
through a pipe like the sysfs netlink, which is in use to deal with
other stuff.

Exactly, that has direct impact not only on the process waiting for
thermal notifications, but also on other process listening to sysfs.

The complexity of such communication (or even the current status of
sysfs ABI) starts to reach limit of such channel. We may definitely
consider other means, such as /dev interface, just like IIO does.

I have created a wiki for LPC 2016
http://wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2016:thermal

Overall I believe we need to solve the (temperature) sensing in a more
structured way within the kernel. We have three subsystem that allow
performing temperature sensing. They are different in design and
concept, but still solve similar problems.

I would still prefer to get this better architectured.

Of course, we do not need to wait until LPC to start drafting this.

Again, please lets generate enough quorum to run the micro conf.
