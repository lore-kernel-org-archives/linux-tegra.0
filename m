It seems odd to me that someone would call this function and either
there are no clocks in the DT or they are all filtered out. For example,
most drivers are calling of_clk_get() because there are clocks they need
to add.

However, a nice comprise here could be to return the number of clocks
added and let the user decide what to do. I like that idea. Not sure I
understand what you mean by "0 vs. the actual number of clocks added".
Do you just mean the return the number added?

I see, that is unfortunate. Are you using the void *data variable in
your filter? If not may be you could use this to indicate a clock has
been 'found' and don't match any further clocks.

If you cannot use it, then I am tempted to drop the filter function for
now as this simplifies the code. It can always be added later if someone
has a need for it.
