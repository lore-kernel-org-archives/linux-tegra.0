If you read the patch, the branches which are changed are those which
do indeed return in some way.  There are those which do this having
moved lr to a different register.

As you point out, "bx lr" /may/ be treated specially (I've actually bee=
n
discussing this with Will Deacon over the last couple of days, who has
also been talking to the hardware people in ARM, and Will is happy with
this patch as in its current form.)  This is why I've changed all
"mov pc, reg" instructions which return in some way to use this macro,
and left others (those which are used to call some function and return
back to the same point) alone.

I have thought about introducing a "call" macro for those other sites,
but as there are soo few of them, I've left them as-is for the time
being (this patch is already large enough.)

If there are any in the patch which you have specific concerns about,
please specifically point them out those which give you a concern.

Thanks.
