Oops, it was actually v2.

As the pin state in suspend is optional, I dont  want to return error if 
the sleep state is not available.

However, it seems pinctrl take care of retuning success if there is no 
sleep state. By seeing code.
Let me test this on different condition and it it works fine then we can 
return the return of pinctrl_pm_select_*()


BTW, it should be OK to have pwm_tegra_resume/suspend wrapper, not 
directly use the pinctrl_pm_select_* in pm ops suspend/resume. The 
prototype matches.

I am planning to populate the GPU regulator which is PWM based. This 
will only populate the regulator.
