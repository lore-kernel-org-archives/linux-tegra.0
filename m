I think that this would be the best way of providing iommu support for 
dma mapping
subsystem(s). I initially put it in arm/mm/dma-mapping.c because it was 
the first
approach of integrating generic IOMMU with DMA-mapping and it was simply 
easier to
have all the code in one place. Now, when second client of such approach 
comes, it
should be much easier to identify which part of the code is common and 
which one is
specific to particular implementation. Feel free to ask any questions if 
you need
help. I don't have access to any ARM64 machine or simulator, so I can 
only review
the code.

Best regards
