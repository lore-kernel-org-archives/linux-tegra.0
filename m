IIRC it was somewhere around here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/7/662

See the parent messages too.

For all the (limited) use cases I considered, playing the power-off sequence 
when power-on fails just works. If power-off also fails you are potentially in 
more trouble though. Maybe we could have another "run" function that does not 
stop on errors for handling such cases where you want to "stop everything you 
can".

The driver could always inspect the sequence, but you are right in that this 
is not how it is intended to be done.

Failures might be better handled if sequences have some "recovery policy" 
about what to do when they fail, as mentioned in the link above. As you 
pointed out, the driver might not always know enough about the resources 
involved to do the right thing.
