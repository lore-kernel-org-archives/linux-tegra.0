I haven't applied it yet because it doesn't apply to the branch it needs
to (that being the debug choice cleanup):

Patching 7806/1...
git apply --whitespace=fix -p1 --index --check > /tmp/pdb.12252 2>&1 exited with non-zero status: 256
error: patch failed: arch/arm/Kconfig.debug:1052
error: arch/arm/Kconfig.debug: patch does not apply

Not even with gnu patch:

patching file arch/arm/Kconfig.debug
Hunk #1 FAILED at 1052.
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/arm/Kconfig.debug.rej
patching file arch/arm/include/debug/tegra.S

This is because at the moment, that branch is based before other
changes which have gone in during the -rcs, namely b6992fa9a7.  It
needs that branch rebased before it can be applied.  I'll get to it
eventually.
