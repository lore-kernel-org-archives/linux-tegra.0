Thanks for explaining it further.
I understand this fact. And i am sure this case does not arise in exynos.
For Tegra, Stephen noted this fact about the ehci driver and the
corresponding PHY.
So that the PHY does a devm_ioremap() only.
For other platforms too we did not get any concerns raised, so we
moved ahead with the series
for merging.

Ok, this explains things.
