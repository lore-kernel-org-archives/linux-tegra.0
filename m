Sorry for the delay, I have been meaning to get back to this thread. Yes
patch #3 is definitely interesting and highlights power-domain
complexities with various SoCs ...

So it seems in this solution you are creating a pseudo device in order
to control the pm-domain.

Right, but what if the device is not bound to the pm-domain? What if due
to pm-domain complexities we need to have finer granularity over the
control of pm-domains?

It seems to me that because we don't always have foresight into the
creativeness of the SoC h/w designers, may be the pm-domain framework
needs to expose APIs to allow direct control of the pm-domains without
binding the pm-domain to the device, so that these APIs can be called in
the context on the runtime-pm callbacks as we do for clocks, etc.

Do you see any benefit to being able to directly control the pm-domains?

That said, I did recently add a patch to prevent the expose of the
pm-domain struct to clients in order to be able to remove them [0].
However, ref-counting can obviously be used to allow client to request
handles to pm-domains.

Cheers
Jon
