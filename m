So your PCI controller driver knows how to program the controller bus
number aperture?  Sometimes people start by assuming that two host
bridges both have [bus 00-ff] apertures, then they enumerate below the
first and adjust the bus number apertures based on what they found.
For example, if they found buses 00-12 behind the first bridge, they
make the apertures [bus 00-12] for the first bridge and [bus 13-ff]
for the second.  That might be the case, depending on what firmware
set up, but it seems like a dubious way to do it, and of course it
precludes a lot of hot-plug scenarios.

Ah, OK, so definitely not standard PCIe ECAM.
