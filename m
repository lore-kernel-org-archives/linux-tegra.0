Ok, I will push that patches first and then we can go for this patch.

I agree that many issues are there in this piece of code.
Originally, continuous double support was added only for glitch less 
audio playback. The audio driver makes some requests and the request in 
dma-queue get programmed before the current dma complete and so after 
buffer transfer completion, it will jump to newly programmed value 
without pausing or transfer gap in dma transfer and so no audio glitch. 
The last request was always like silence so that dma can be stop before 
wrapping up actual audio data. Some of the code is missing in this file 
which was fixed.
Currently the audio driver is not using the continuous double buffering 
mechanism, it is using the oneshot dma and you may have small glitches 
in audio when you run higher sampling rate audio.

Here I agree with your thought: continuous double buffering mechanism 
should be in loop if it is last request i.e. do not delete last req 
until client call dequeue or stop_dma. If new request queued then dma 
will start transfer to new address/size once current is completed and 
loop on that request forever.

Currently it is not implemented like that. I will correct this with 
proper documentation on header file about this mode.
