That is somewhat similar, but I don't think quite the same:

* That thread deals with a single interrupt source and a single sink, which
need to negotiate to use one of n possible interrupt types. Whereas this
thread is about a sink connected to a source+sink connected to a sink.

* That thread dealt with negotiating one of n supported types, whereas
this thread is about a restricted sink (GIC only supporting high types),
connecting through an intermediary to a source, and I have no idea whether
that source is flexible and can support both high or low types; I assume
it can only support low types.

I suppose if the auto-negotiation logic were enhanced to jump across n
levels instead of just 1 link, it might be applicable. That sounds complex
though.
