I guess technically, the usbhost controller resides in one partition and
the super-speed logic in another. So could the usbhost domain be the
primary? Possibly, but the device cannot be probed without both enabled.

It might be possible for this case, but to be honest, the more I think
about this, I do wonder if we need to be able to make the framework a
lot more flexible for devices that need multiple power-domains. In other
words, for devices that use multiple domains allow them to control them
similarly to what we do for regulators or clocks. So if there is more
than one defined, then the genpd core will not bind the device to the
pm-domain and let the driver handle it. This way if you do need more
granular control of the pm-domains in the driver you can do whatever you
need to.

I know that Rajendra (CC'ed) was looking into whether he had a need to
control multiple power-domains individually from within the context of a
single device driver.
