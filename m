No problem. I should point out the above is for the #power-domain-cells
= <0> case.

OK, fair enough. Any in particular you are concerned about?

Right that is a concern, however, I think that in the long-term we would
be better off with the power-domains being controlled by the same
underlying code as opposed to something different.
