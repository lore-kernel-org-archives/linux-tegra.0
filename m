Yes, that's expected. I should have mentioned that this patch depends on
changes in the new series that added the new Tegra pinctrl driver, but
that hasn't been applied to the Tegra branches since I need to rework the
Tegra board files for changes in the pinctrl API etc. I'll repost patches
once all the pinctrl rework is finalized.
