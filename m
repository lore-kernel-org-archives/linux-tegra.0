Interesting, I hadn't thought about that. I suppose this means that the
module will end up containing an unused section with the fixup code. It
might be useful to add a way for that to trigger a warning at build
time.

Perhaps to fix this a mechanism could be introduced to add a table of
fixups to a host controller driver and that will get applied to all
children of the bridge. It could be problematic to cover all of the
different fixup stages, though.
