Ah, I finally got it - we are just setting it to the *address* of
host->dma_mask so the device's DMA mask does not end up being a NULL
pointer.

That actually changes things a bit. DMA-capable devices are clearly
expected to set the mask themselves, but the only one to do it is
host/mtk-sd.c. And dma_set_mask() is only called in dw_mmc and
sdhci-acpi's enable_dma callback.

This means most DMA-capable devices (including Tegra, but not only)
are simply left with no DMA setup at all.

Probably we can detect when the host did not do any DMA setup in the
probe function and attempt some sane defaults depending on what the
hardware says it is capable of?
