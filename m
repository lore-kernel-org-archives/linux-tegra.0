I didn't read these mails enough to notice that they were asking for an
ack, they were followups to already discarded patches (the were
discarded due to the testing problems).  One of the things I do to deal
with mail overload is to drop followups to patches that I don't remember
reviewing (as in this case where the negative test reports arrived
before I saw the patches) or where I remember I was already happy.

I knew it was a dependency, I didn't know that there were no further
changes required to the series - your note when you posted the patch
didn't mention anything.
