I've filed a bug to request better documentation.

Looking at our downstream driver, the quoted comment below implies
that the address space layout is pretty arbitrary and programmable at
least for Tegra30. The code in function
tegra_pcie_setup_translations() appears to support this (and is
executed for both Tegra20 and Tegra30, even though the comment for
Tegra20 doesn't mention any programmability).

Tegra20:

(I guess by "is split", it means the driver sets it up that way, not
that the HW is fixed that way)
