Ok thanks. Can you put your comments there, so that somebody can start
responding.
It will be really helpful.
I have already sent the reminder, but still no response.
I know it will be difficult to debug like this, but at least some
pointers or support will definitely help.
Basically I wanted to know, if there is any problem from SoC side
itself, or it is specific to emmc driver issue.
Because, with the kernel 4.4 (and our internal patches), other SoC
(such as hikey), it is working fine.

I am using tegra-l4t-r27.1 release, and on top of that we have our
internal patches for snapshot image.
However, I also compared with r28 repo under drivers/mmc/*
There were not major difference. Still I tried to manually apply few
of the changes to r27, but it still it did not help much.
That is the reason I thought to discuss, so that somebody can point
me, if I am missing any right fixes.
Because from r27 to r28, with our internal patches is again a painful task.
So first I wanted to make sure if some patches backing from r28 works,
then I can recommend to upgrade to r28.

Its actually our internal command, something like:
# echo snap > /sys/power/state
This internally create our snapshot image and save it on disk.
Then we boot the system normally with this image.
Note: currently to debug the emmc issue, we are right now booting with sd-card.
