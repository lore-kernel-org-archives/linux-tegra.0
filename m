Sorry for the confusion, I mean this data structure is the private data=
 pointer,
it doesn't handled by thermal_core. Let me explain more:
In this tegra soctherm driver, I run following steps in probe routine:
step1:
z =3D devm_thermal_zone_of_sensor_register(*dev, sensor_id, zone, ops);
register thermal zone device, in here, the parameter "zone" is the priv=
ate data
pointer "structure tegra_thermctl_zone".
step 2:
After register, it return the "z", and I set it to the private data:
zone->tz =3D z;

In the .set_trip() callback, it will pass back this private data pointe=
r.
So if the callback was called between step1 and step2, at that time the=
 zone->tz
didn't be set yet, it will cause problems, although I didn't hit this c=
ase.

This check doesn't relate with core driver, it is used to check my priv=
ate data
pointer.

Wei.
