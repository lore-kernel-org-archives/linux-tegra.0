You and linux-acpi have been copied on v2 and later of the entire
series I think.

The problem for DT is we don't generically know what are the
dependencies at a core level. We could know some or most dependencies
if phandles (links to other nodes) were typed, but they are not. If
the core had this information, we could simply control the device
creation to order probing. Instead, this information is encoded into
the bindings and binding parsing resides in the subsystems. That
parsing happens during probe of the client side and is done by the
subsystems (for common bindings). Since we already do the parsing at
this point, it is a convenient place to trigger the probe of the
dependency. Is ACPI going to be similar in this regard?

=46undamentally, it is a question of probe devices when their
dependencies are present or drivers ensure their dependencies are
ready. IIRC, init systems went thru a similar debate for service
dependencies.

How so? The one line is in DT binding parsing code in subsystems, not
driver core. The driver core change is we add every device (that
happened to be created by DT) to the deferred probe list, so they
don't probe right away.

I don't think DT is special and we avoid DT specific core changes as
much as possible. I think the difference is DT uses platform_device
and ACPI does not. It used to be separate, but got merged together
primarily to support the plethora of existing drivers. Anyway, that is
all outside of anything in this series.

Sorry, I don't follow what "that" or "it" is.
