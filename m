Yes, it's true. I realize the role of CPU0 is the same across all
current Tegra chips. Although we can support independent power gate for
CPU0 in Tegra114/124, for cluster power control it still needs to be set
up by CPU0 (last down and first up). So I send this patch for tunning
the code that only need for CPU0.

Good catch. Will fix.
