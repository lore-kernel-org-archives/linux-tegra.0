I think getting the interrupts resolved at probe time would be the
better thing to do first. That problem is well understood.

I unfortunately don't know enough about IOMMU configuration to comment
intelligently about how the binding should be set up. My gut instinct is
that device nodes should have references to the IOMMU so that all the
information is easily at hand when a driver attempts to probe. Having
references from the IOMMU node to the devices /seems/ backwards. Will
Deacon I think would be a better person to talk about it with.
