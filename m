I also tried to find the code that handles bounce buffers for the attached
devices in the absence of SWIOTLB (which ARM does not use). The mmc block
driver handles this correctly with the blk_queue_bounce_limit() call,
and any SDIO network devices will work as long as they

a) don't advertize NETIF_F_HIGHDMA, and
b) all memory that is out of reach of the SDHCI device is also
   beyond the highmem boundary (this might not be true with
   CONFIG_VMSPLIT_1G)

All other SDIO devices (camera, DVB, bluetooth) might need driver
changes or SWIOTLB support here, but those devices are fairly rare,
and it's possible that all upstream drivers are actually ok.
