I'd like Peter to review this too (CC'd). I guess it looks OK...

That comment is quite unclear. In particular the first sentence says "if
something" rather than "if something then something". Can you please
re-write it?

Also, it'd be good to explain (or at least briefly reference) the boot
path for a cold-boot CPU and a warm boot CPU; I assume that somehow a
cold boot CPU doesn't execute tegra_secondary_init(), but a warm boot
CPU does?

Are the units/frequency of the jiffies variable always constant? Should
"5" be not a constant, but instead a calculation involving HZ or
msecs_to_jiffies()? Certainly, the few other uses of time_before() I
looked at use HZ or msecs_to_jiffies().
