Sounds good. Jon, we're OK with merging from a github repo or similar
as well, if you have more than a few patches. Please re-send them to
arm@kernel.org with your sign-off when you have something (it's a lot
easier than if you just cc us on an acked-by, since gmail+imap doesn't
pop the whole thread over into my arm@ folder. :)

We can even host a rebasing/staging/temporary branch for you in case
you want something to be in -next but might not be 100% that it should
go in, if needed -- just let us know.

Yeah, hopefully not much. And thanks a lot for communicating your
vacation schedules, it's useful for us to know!
