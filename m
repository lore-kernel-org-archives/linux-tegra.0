Please think about it again.
The ring buffer becomes the effective h/w fifo. And you don't have to
wait at all for the mailbox register to clear .... you could simply
overwrite it when Linux puts some data in the ring-buffer (the data
written will just be a 'hint' command for remote to go look into the
ring-buffer for new data).

Even if the Linux crashes, whatever data is placed in the ring-buffer
will eventually be printed by the still-alive remote.

Anyways once we have the flush api, I don't really care how broken your f/w is.
