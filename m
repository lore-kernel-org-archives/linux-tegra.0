Don't know the details about the limitations for SDHCI, but I guess
similar exists for other controllers as well.

I do get the impression that we have got a problem in the mmc
core/block layer for how erase/trim/discard timeouts are being
handled.

I don't think the mmc hw-controller should be waiting for the R1B
response from the CMD38 as long as this "timeout" we are discussing
here. According to the spec, at least how I interpret it, the card
should respond rather quickly to CMD38, then it will assert the DAT0
line to indicate busy.

The total time the card is allowed to stay busy, that is what the
timeout specifies. We may either use a mmc hw-controller busy
detection mechanism or send CMD13 to poll for status. The latter is
somewhat already being handled in mmc_do_erase(), but we are using
"MMC_CORE_TIMEOUT_MS" instead of the correct timeout.

Kind regards
