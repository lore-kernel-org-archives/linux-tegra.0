That's not what I meant. For example, you have a clk-tegra124.c file
built for two SoCs already and there may be more coming. Instead of
multiple obj-y of the same file, just add the entry below to
drivers/clk/tegra/Kconfig:

config CLK_TEGRA124
	bool "NVIDIA Tegra 124 clock"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA_124_SOC || (ARM64 && ARCH_TEGRA)
	default y
	help
	  Used on Tegra 124, 132 etc.
	  ...

Note that I preserved the 124_SOC dependency for the 32-bit arm case.
But for arm64, just make it dependent on ARCH_TEGRA.

Once done, the Makefile only needs a single entry:

obj-$(CONFIG_TEGRA124) += clk-tegra124.o
