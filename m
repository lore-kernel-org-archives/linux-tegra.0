I asked Linus Walleij about that with the fwnode_get_named_gpiod() stuff,
and Linus didn't seem to know how this should be used.

It doesn't help that dev->fwnode is not initialised, but dev->of_node
is.  Are we supposed to grope around in dev->of_node for the embedded
fwnode instead of using dev->fwnode?

At the moment, at least to me, fwnode looks like some kind of
experimental half-baked thing rather than a real usable solution.
