Only to specify multiple power-domains for a device and not the later.

It is an interesting point but today we have always kept the superspeed
partition on if the device is configured for superspeed regardless of
what is actually connected. I will check to see if the h/w would allow
us to turn it off if a non-superspeed device is in use but I did not
think so.

Do you have any interesting use-cases that would make use of this or
require other such enhancements?

Cheers
Jon
