No problem.

The two main clocks sources (there are others) used for the CPU complex
are the PLLX and the DFLL. The PLLX is a normal PLL and you can
configure to run at various frequencies. However, this PLL requires that
you/software set the voltage appropriately. The DFLL has the ability to
control the voltage itself per the frequency requested (no software
management of the voltage required).

There is no reason why you could not use the PLLX in conjunction with
cpufreq, but for T124 we use the DFLL.

Typically, T124 will boot using the PLLX and then if cpufreq is enabled,
the DFLL will be enabled and we will switch to this clock.

We would only ever switch back to the PLLX if cpufreq is removed and
hence the DFLL is disabled. And this is where this patch comes in and I
am wondering if this has ever been tested.

I don't think so. At probe time for cpufreq, we know the clock source
for the CPU complex and we can query the voltage and frequency. You may
say what happens if you are already running from the DFLL that happened
to be setup by the bootloader? It is probably not likely as there is
more software setup involved before you can enable the DFLL. However, it
could be handled.

By the way, I am not saying that we should do this, but if we don't we
need to define a safe/default V-F for all devices to operate at. I guess
that it could also be specified in the DTB and if not we use a default.
