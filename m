Thanks for the comment. We have already started some discussion with the
Nvidia guys about supporting also latency and priority. We can do a
structure based approach and pass a struct with all the bandwidth /
latency / priority stuff to a function like icc_set_extended(); It's
very early for any conclusions yet and for now we support only
bandwidth. The function name still can be easy changed with a follow-up
patch until one is using it yet. Let me think again.

Regarding DT, all settings should go into the drivers for now and
later we can decide if something makes sense to be really in device-tree.

Thanks,
Georgi
