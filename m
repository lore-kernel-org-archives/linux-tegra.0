Yes, that's true in general, but in this specific driver
pwm_get_period() is never called, and the driver only relies on the
pb->period value.

IMHO, if we had to support default period values for non DT boards, the
proper way would be to pass something in the PWM platform data and let
the PWM driver (or PWM core) initialize the default PWM state.
This way the PWM user could rely on the pwm_get_default_period() helper
to extract the default period value.
