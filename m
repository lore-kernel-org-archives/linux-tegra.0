No, because the lava farms tend not to be public.

I'm not sure about that, because what I was thinking of is adding
a flag which would be set at late_initcall() time prior to running
a final round of deferred device probing.

This flag would then be used in a deferred_warn() printk function
which would normally be silent, but when this flag is set, it would
print the reason for the deferral - and this would replace (or be
added) to the subsystems and drivers which return -EPROBE_DEFER.

That has the effect of hiding all the deferrals up until just before
launching into userspace, which should then acomplish two things -
firstly, getting rid of the rather useless deferred messages up to
that point, and secondly printing the reason why the remaining
deferrals are happening.

That should be a small number of new lines plus a one-line change
in subsystems and drivers.
