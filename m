I'm not quite sure, but isn't this the opposite of what's wanted. I
think that setting this flag in prep() means that the SPI driver need
not explicitly ack it later?

At least, tegra_dma_desc_get() returns an allocated descriptor if one
exists and async_tx_test_ack()==true for it, and it's true when the
DMA_CTRL_ACK flag is set, which happens either due to calling
async_tx_ack(), or because tegra_dma_prep_slave_sg() was called with
DMA_CTRL_ACK in flags.
