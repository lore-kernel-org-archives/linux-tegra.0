Would it not be 75% of the time where we have 1 of 4 CPUs active? At
least, that's assuming that all work is evenly distributed amongst CPUs,
and hence it's random which CPU is the last to go idle, but perhaps
that's not the case if CPU0 is somehow special workload-wise?

But yes, some stats gathered from real-world use-cases could well be
interesting.
