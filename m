I do think this case is exceptional because both the DTS and driver code
are wrong, whereas the binding is correct.

So the reasonable thing to do here is to fix the code and DTS files. The
only thing I'm still somewhat concerned about is the fallout from this.

Looking at the code it seems that the ACOK GPIO is primarily used to
report the "charger present" and "charging/discharging" status. However
that status is also used to enable or disable charging. So from what I
can tell breaking compatibility here would cause device to no longer be
able to charge, which could potentially brick users' devices.

Then again, I'm not sure how the hardware works exactly. If the device
will still function with an empty battery but with a charger connected,
and I suspect it will, then users would still be able to hook up their
chargers, which they eventually have to do anyway, to boot and update
the DTB to fix this.

Now as for the amount of users concerned: I see this charger used only
on Tegra boards. Of those I don't think Venice2 and Tegra132 Norrin have
ever been available outside NVIDIA, so I don't think we'd have to
concern ourselves with them. Even if somebody was still using them
they'd have to be developers that would likely start out by copying new
kernel *and* DTB to the device.

Nyan-based devices, on the other hand, are fairly popular. I suspect
that not many actually run upstream kernels on them, and those that do
will certainly know how to update the DTS along with the kernel.

I think the primary reason for requiring backwards-compatibility is that
the DTB could be stored in a read-only location. So if there is no way
to upgrade the DTB it's fairly natural that we can't ever break ABI with
it.

Anyway, I think I've captured in full above what the potential fallout
=66rom this break would be. Essentially things will continue to work as-is
but if users end up not updating their DTB along with the kernel their
battery will drain. The fix for this would be to update the DTB, which
on Nyan boards can be easily done along with the kernel.

The advantages would be that other boards and OSes wouldn't have to deal
with a trivial logical error that was made a long time ago.

Rob, any chance you could grant an exception under the above
circumstances?
