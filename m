ready_count is an internal state of core coupled code, and will change
significantly in the next version of the patches.  Drivers cannot
depend on it.

Why not set a flag from CPU1 when it exits the low power state, and
have CPU0 spin on the powerdomain register or the flag?  You can then
use the parallel barrier function to ensure both cpus have seen the
flag and reset it to 0 before returning.
