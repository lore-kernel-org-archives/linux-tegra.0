Hi Mark,

I will drop this change from this series and will take up generic MSI work in the next series of changes for pci-tegra driver.
Even without this change, pci-tegra driver will work fine as a builtin module. So other changes can still be reviewed and
can be considered as initial step for adding LKM support for pci-tegra.

Thanks,
Manikanta
