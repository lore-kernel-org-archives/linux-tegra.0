I think I've seen this before as well but hadn't had the time to
investigate further. The devices that failed to initialize were serial
ports I think. Perhaps the ordering here is the key. All the drivers
that I use for the PCI devices are loaded as modules, so they'll probe
the devices much later anyway. The serial driver is an exception here as
it is builtin.

To me this looks like a problem in the probing code. Drivers' .probe()
shouldn't be called on devices that haven't had their resources assigned
yet. Perhaps nobody has ever seen this before because the ordering
always ensured that the PCI controller driver was loaded first.
