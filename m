The thing I don't understand here is why would anyone want power
sequences without the DT representation. Guys, that's the whole point! :)

If we are to implement things into drivers, then callback functions
are going to serve us just as well - even better, for they are more
flexible. All we need to do is define a dedicated ops structure and
have the driver plug the right callback functions depending on the
"compatible" property of the DT device node. We don't need a framework
for that.

And if we are not going to use power seqs that's probably what we
should do in order to get panels to work on Tegra boards for now. Then
see how things turn out with the panel framework and whether there is
a use for power seqs in it. But by the meantime, I don't see any
motivation to merge power seqs sans DT support.

Alex.
