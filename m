Yeah, I don't want 3/3 merged because we don't have a functional EMC 
clock yet on T124, and because I don't know yet where will be the best 
place to have that code in. That depends on Mikko's work on the real EMC 
driver which is in a bit of flux right now.

I have kept posting it just because I think it complements nicely the 
explanation in the cover letter, but maybe confuses more than helps.

Tomeu
