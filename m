What is it about disabling PM that you consider useful? I can understand
why you'd want that option if power management is broken, but as far as
I can tell, power management on Tegra is in pretty good state, and it's
more likely that !PM would actually be broken (though I haven't built a
configuration like that in a couple of years, so I'm speculating). We
already can't disable PM on 64-bit ARM, so I don't understand why 32-bit
ARM should be treated any differently.
