The test is against (!(host->flags & (SDHCI_USE_SDMA |
SDHCI_USE_ADMA))), (see the '!') so it will be true (and the DMA mask
will be set) if both flags are *not* set (why we set the mask to 64
bits here in that case, I don't know).

T210 is capable of SDMA, so we cannot use this condition for that
purpose (maybe you missed the '!', in which case I understand why you
were surprised).

Ok, I think you probably missed the '!' then. :)

It is not a limitation of the controller - I am just limiting the mask
to the range of physical memory we can ever access on T210. My intent
here is to overcome the default 32-bit mask, not to limit the range,
so I could have set a 64-bit mask if not for my OCD. :P

But actually looking at how the various flags are interpreted in
sdhci_add_host(), I see the following:

    /*
     * It is assumed that a 64-bit capable device has set a 64-bit DMA mask
     * and *must* do 64-bit DMA.  A driver has the opportunity to change
     * that during the first call to ->enable_dma().  Similarly
     * SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA must be left to the drivers to
     * implement.
     */
    if (caps[0] & SDHCI_CAN_64BIT)
        host->flags |= SDHCI_USE_64_BIT_DMA;

Since this relies on what the hardware declares being capable of and
is set on T210, I am very tempted to set a 64-bit dma_mask here and
call it a day, but the above comment seems to suggest that this should
have been done before.

If you think this is cool though, I will just do that and in
conjunction with patch 1 this will do the job nicely.
