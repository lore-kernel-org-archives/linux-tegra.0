I took some time to have a look at all of them and actually I am happy
with the end result, except that I would prefer if you squash them all
in and rewrite the logs since I can easily miss something (eg I have no
insights into the Tegra config space FPCI windowing mechanism) - I will
merge the resulting patch(es).

I have a question: after merging both series, are

tegra_pcie_{add/remove}_bus()

(and struct tegra_pcie_bus)

still needed ? I do not think so.

If the testing goes OK please send me unified series and will merge
that one.

This brings me to a question for you and Bjorn: how do you usually
handle DT updates ? I assume we send them via the PCI tree but I am
asking to prevent any issue upfront.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
