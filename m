I don't think that's so with the various flavours of platform specific
uboot which float around.  For instance, on the OMAP4430 SDP, the
following commands were used as supplied to load a uImage off the SD
card into RAM at a different address to which it was built for, and
execute it at that address:

mmcinit 0
fatload mmc 0 0x80300000 uImage
bootm 80300000

Whether the 'bootm' command then copied the image and called it there,
or whether it executed it at 0x80300000 I've no idea - but why then
load the image at a different address in the first place?
