I agree that we need to support your use case but how to do it
is not yet clear to me.

In your above example the otg controller knows what are the host
and gadget controllers but the host/gadget devices don't
know who is their otg controller.

So the problem is that when usb_otg_register_hcd/gadget() is called
we need to get a handle to the otg controller.

One solution I see is to iterate over the registered otg_controller_list
and check if we match the host/gadget controller in there.

Then there is also a possibility that host/gadget controllers get
registered before the OTG controller. Then we can't know for sure if
the host/gadget controller was meant for dual-role operation or not
and it will resort to single role operation.

Any idea to prevent the above situation?

Maybe we need to add some logic in host/gadget cores to check if the port
is meant for dual-role use and defer probe if OTG controller is not yet
registered?

cheers,
