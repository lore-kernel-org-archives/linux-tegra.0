I agree that in generally busy-waiting is a bad idea and shouldn't be
encouraged. However, I also think that an exception proves the rule. If
you look at the console drivers in drivers/tty/serial, all of them will
busy loop prior to or after sending a character. This is pretty much
part of the API and as such busy-looping is very much a feature.

The reason why this is done is because on one hand we have an atomic
context and on the other hand we want to make sure that all characters
actually make it to the console when we print them.

As an example how this can break, I've taken your suggestion to
implement a producer/consumer mode in the TCU driver where the console
write function will just stash characters into a circular buffer and a
work queue will then use mbox_send_message() to drain the circular
buffer. While this does work on the surface, I was able to concern both
of the issues that I was concerned about: 1) it is easy to overflow the
circular buffer by just dumping enough data at once to the console and
2) when a crash happens, everything in the kernel stops, including the
consumer workqueue that is supposed to drain the circular buffer and
flush messages to the TCU. The result is that, in my particular case,
the boot log will just stop at a random place in the middle of messages
=66rom much earlier in the boot because the TCU hasn't caught up yet and
there's a lot of characters still in the circular buffer.

Now, 1) can be mitigated by increasing the circular buffer size. A value
that seems to give reliably good results in 2 << CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. I
thought that I could also mitigate 2) by busy looping in the TCU driver,
but it turns out that that doesn't work. The reason is that since we are
in atomic context with all interrupts disabled, the mailbox won't ever
consume any new characters, so the read pointer in the circular buffer
won't increment, leaving me with no condition upon which to loop that
would work.

Given that 2) can't be solved makes this implementation of the TCU
completely useless as a console.

All of that said, have you had a chance to look at my other proposed
solution for this? I sent it out yesterday, but you can also find the
series here:

	http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-tegra/list/?series=3D78477

The difference to the earlier versions is that the flushing is now
explicit. I think this combines the best of both worlds. On one hand it
makes the mechanism completely opt-in, so nothing gets hidden in the
regular functions. On the other hand, it allows clients to make use of
this functionality very explicitly. A client that doesn't call the
mbox_flush() function will just not busy-loop. But clients that need to
make sure messages are flushed in atomic contexts can now do that. Does
that sound like a more acceptable solution to you? We could even go and
add documentation to mbox_flush() that it should only be used under
special circumstances.

If you still think that's a bad idea, do you have any other suggestions
on how to move forward?
