Here are the issues that happen after apply CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP.
1) Tegra114/30
The warning message at kernel/time/tick-broadcast.c:667
tick_broadcast_oneshot_control could be triggered when doing CPU hot
plug stress test.

2) Tegra20
The system is easy to stick or become lag.
The CPU hot plug is easy to cause system stick too.

The fix I suggested in another mail looks can fix all the issues above.
I verified it again today on 3 different Tegra SoC platforms.

Thanks,
Joseph
