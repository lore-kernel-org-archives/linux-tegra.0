I missed replying to this email until now when I started looking at
picking up branches for the 3.4 staging, sorry for the delay.

Russell, would you prefer merging in v3.3-rc2 into your branch so I
can pull the exact same resolution from there, or should we do it
locally in arm-soc? It probably makes sense for you to do it so
there's no more conflicts from there on out for dependent branches.
