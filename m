I guess that would be painful. There are probably a lot more valid
version numbers for a SW firmware interface than there are for a HW IP
block interface, so it makes less sense to encoded the version into the
compatible value, at least in cases where the interface is "similar
enough"; we can add some kind of basic version number into the
compatible values for radically different interfaces if they appear in
the future.

Is there a need for a menu at all? I suppose it might group things
nicely. If so, how about:

config ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE
	bool

config ARCH_SUPPORTS_TRUSTED_FOUNDATIONS
	bool
	select ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE

config ARCH_SUPPORTS_SOME_OTHER_FW
	bool
	select ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE

menu "Firmware options"
	depends on ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE

That's probably slightly easier to read than a huge "depends" statement
in the menu stanza, and ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE might be a useful to
build in support for any core firmware utility code.
