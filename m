Sorry about that. On reviewing this with the audio team at NVIDIA, I was
told we don't support S24_LE for I2S. The reason being that the crossbar
between the DMA and I2S is not able to extract the correct 24-bits from
the 32-bit sample to feed to the I2S interface. The Tegra documentation
does show support for 24-bits, but not state explicit support for S24_LE.

Now Ben says that he has this working, but I am unable to reproduce
this, so before just dropping the S24_LE support, I would like to
understand how this is working for Ben in case there is something that
we have overlooked here.
