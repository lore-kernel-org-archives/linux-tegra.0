Consider a SoC with two I2C ports at address 1_00000000 and 2_00000000 
physical. The top 32-bits (2nd cell) of the address must be represented 
in the unit address, or the nodes won't have a unique name.

Perhaps Rob is simply saying that multi-cell values should be treated as 
a single large integer, rather than comma-separating each cell value? I 
perhaps mistakenly took his comment to mean that only a single address 
cell should be used in the unit address.

T124 has a >32-bit bus since it supports >2GB RAM (via LPAE) (although 
not a full 64-bit bus I would imagine). That alone means we need two 
cells in DT to represent large RAM layouts.
