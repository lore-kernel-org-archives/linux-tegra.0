Indeed, we shouldn't. Unless I am mistaken, the issue is then that the 
cpufreq cooling device calls thermal_cooling_device_register before 
being ready to handle callbacks, which clearly would be an issue in the 
cpufreq driver.

The thermal core seems to able to handle registrations of thermal zones 
and cooling devices in any order; AFAICT it defers binding the tz<->cdev 
mapping until both have registered themselves to the thermal core.
