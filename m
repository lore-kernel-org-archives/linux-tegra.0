Due to some enhancements for supporting multiple functions of HSP 
sub-modules in the same driver, I re-wrote some parts of the bindings 
and driver.

I think I will just list "doorbell" for now. And adding more later once 
we add other HSP sub-module support.

Currently the usage of HSP HW in the downstream kernel is something like 
the model below.

remote_processor_A-\
remote_processor_B--->hsp@1000 (doorbell func) <-> host CPU
remote_processor_C-/

remote_processor_D -> hsp@2000 (shared mailbox) <-> CPU

remote_processor_E -> hsp@3000 (shared mailbox) <-> CPU

I am thinking if we can just add the appropriate compatible strings for 
it to replace "nvidia,tegra186-hsp". e.g. "nvidia,tegra186-hsp-doorbell" 
and "nvidia,tegra186-hsp-sharedmailbox". So the driver can probe and 
initialize correctly depend on the compatible property. How do you think 
about it? Is this the same as the (b) you mentioned above?

Because these values are available in the HSP_INT_DIMENSIONING register, 
so remove them.

Okay.

Yes, true. Will fix.
