Will do that.

Yes, we could use the panel model here instead. Not sure how many other panels 
follow the same powering sequence though.

Making it Ventana-specific would have allowed to group all Tegra board support 
into the same driver, and considering that probably not many devices use the 
same panels as we do this seemed to make sense at first.

Indeed, even though there is only one gpio here. Maybe we could group them 
into a single property and retrieve them by index - that's what the DT GPIO 
APIs seem to be designed for initially.

Sorry, I don't get your point here - could you elaborate?

That's what would make the most sense indeed, but would require some extra 
changes in pwm-backlight and might go against Thierry's wish to keep it 
simple. On the other hand I totally agree this would be more elegant. Every 
pwm-backlight based driver would just need to invoke pwm_bl's probe/remove 
function from its own. Thierry, would that be an acceptable alternative to the 
sub-driver thing despite the slightly deeper changes this involves?

Thanks,
Alex.
