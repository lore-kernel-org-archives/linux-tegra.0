I agree that reflecting the hardware hierarchy within the device tree makes
sense. I'll need to add some code to tear down child devices in the cleanup
path, but that shouldn't be too difficult.

However, adding a whole bus_type implementation would pretty much duplicate
the platform bus code. I guess host1x could just provide struct host1x_clie=
nt
a set of corresponding APIs to create them, request channels, etc.
