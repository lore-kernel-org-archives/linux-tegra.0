Interesting, as this is not the case across all the ARM systems, as
I believe that many of the s3c24xx do not bother to request the GPIOs
before using them as interrupts.

Do we really need to request the GPIO? I suppose it is useful to stop
someone else trying to play with it...

Another interesting problem is to do with using an GPIO that has been
assigned to an interrupt as a readable resource in the driver, since
the 

I would also consider that the implementor of the IRQs set_type configure
the specific GPIO to the correct mode for operating as an interrupt when
it is called... this would reduce any problems of passing GPIOs to drivers
(especially if device tree is being used) to avoid having to do any
arch-specific mode calls.
