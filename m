Jason / Stephen,

Yes, it does indeed default to 0 if not specified.  For arm-gic it
would appear #address-cells must be 0, so should we remove all places
its set explicitly to 0 in dts as wel as the example in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings?

Looking through arch/arm/boot/dts I'm seeing other dts configs using
'arm,cortex-a9-gic' which I'm guessing are equally as wrong as the
imx6 situation:
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/highbank.dts
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/sh73a0.dtsi

I'm also seeing a number of places where its set explicitly to 0:
 - Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/gic.txt
 - Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/vexpress.txt
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm11351.dtsi
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/hi3620.dtsi
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6qdl.dtsi
 - arch/arm/boot/dts/vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7.dts

If I extend this search to the other compatible gic interrupt
controllers implemented in drivers/irqchip/irq-gic.c
(arm,cortex-a15-gic, qcom,msm-8660-qgic, qcom,msm-qgic2) I find even
more examples where #address-cells is set explicitly to 0 or to 1 (and
I would believe a value of 1 is invalid, just as it is in my case).

I'm happy to broaden my patch, but I certainly want to make sure I'm
doing the right thing with it, as I don't have the ability to test all
the other devicetree configs and am by no means a devicetree expert.

Recommendations?

Tim
