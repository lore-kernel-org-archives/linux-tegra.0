    Because the controllers the driver switches between are not companions.
The multiplexing is between PCI EHCI/OHCI and Renesas USBHS (high speed device 
controller in this case) controllers on port 0 and between PCI EHCI/OHCI and 
non-PCI xHCI controller on port 2.

    The PHY really does belong to the USBHS controller but that multiplexing 
register inside it controls routing of the ports 0 and 2; USBHS itself is on 
port 0.

    No, there are also host/device mode DIP switches on the boards which 
control port 0 signals (and the port 0 connector is micro-AB, so both a host 
and device can be connected). The second board also has OTG chip on port 0 
thru which USB ID pin can be read from the micro-AB connector.
