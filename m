For those 2 domains we can find the necessary clocks and resets by parsing
the relevant existing DT nodes for PCIe and gr3d. For clocks, this isn't
even needed as we can always register some extra clkdev's to get them. There
is no equivalent for resets so we have to parse the gr3d and pcie DT nodes,
but that's not too bad I think.

Peter.
