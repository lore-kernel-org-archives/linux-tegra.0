Yes. At least for now. And this patch didn't change that although it
makes it possible to do so if required.

This one is exactly the problem patch series was created for. Which one
is IN and which is OUT is indeed a matter of an agreement - but this
agreement should be clearly visible, well defined and same for all.

It's *annoying* to try finding out whether it was 1 or 0 one should
return from get_direction callback for OUTPUT. This is probably the
reason we have comments like

return 1; /* input */

there.

As this is global agreement for all GPIO framework users - not
something that can be agreed per driver basis - we should have GPIO
framework wide definitions for this. We can just add definitions for
new drivers to benefit - but I think adding them also for existing
drivers improves readability significantly (see below).

Can you please tell me what type of stats you hope to see? I can try
generating what you are after. The cover letter contained typical +/-
change stats from git and summary:

62 files changed, 228 insertions(+), 104 deletions(-)

It sure shows that amount of lines was increased (roughly 2 lines more
/ changed file) - but I guess that was expected as I don't like
ternary. So pretty much each

return !!foo;

was changed to

if (foo)
	return GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_IN;

return GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT;

For me (and hopefully others who don't remember whether 1 is IN or OUT)
this is improved readability while bloat-factor is still pretty low.

From

return !!foo;

one does not know what the foo should be for IN or OUT without reading
some spec or browsing through comments. From latter it is obvious that
if foo is zero the direction is output.
