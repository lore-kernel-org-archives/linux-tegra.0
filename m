In mmc_do_calc_max_discard(), if only a single erase block can be
discarded within the host controller's timeout, don't allow discard
operations at all.

Previously, the code allowed sector-at-a-time discard (rather than
erase-block-at-a-time), which was chronically slow.

Without this patch, on the NVIDIA Tegra Cardhu board, the loops result
in qty == 1, which is immediately returned. This causes discard to
operate a single sector at a time, which is chronically slow. With this
patch in place, discard operates a single erase block at a time, which
is reasonably fast.
