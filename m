I don't have full information on this topic, but there is certainly no
common standard ABI.  Every example I've seen is different so far,
though some will be less different than others.

ARM are baking some proposabls for that, but that doesn't change the
existing software, and it's impossible to predict how rapidly a new
standards proposal would be adopted.  So unfortunately, diversity is
something we will have to cope with for the foreseeable future.

Since existing SMC based firmwares are not safely probeable, describing
what's there using DT feels like the best bet for now.
