OK. I can do this. And I want to add one more patch that can cover the
IPI miss handling issue in coupled cpuidle framework. I will prepare
that for V2. And it means that after V2, you don't need to consider the
fix that I purposed for coupled cpuidle framework. You can merge it if
it pass your review.

I won't squash this in V2 for you to check what difference. If you think
that is ok, I will squash this in V3.

Indeed, this is important for CPU0. For Tegra30, we definitely need a
loop to sync CPUn to power down status first. For Tegra20, the CPU0 only
need to put CPU1 in reset. And we handle these procedure when CPU0 going
to LP2.

Yes. This was used for the coupled driver initialization. It need to
know how many CPUs need to be coupled when registration. It also use the
notifier for updating the mask.

Hmmm. Currently it can't get these info from HW. The procedure is just
like above. Syncing the cpu online mask to know how many CPUs need to be
coupled and updating the mask by notifier.
