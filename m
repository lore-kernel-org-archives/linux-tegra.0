"root clocksource" implies no parents, yet the clock object this driver
registers lists "dfll_soc" as its parent.

Is there a need to make this optional? There's nothing configurable in
the rest of the Tegra clock driver, and it'd be nicer if the rest of the
kernel (e.g. Tegra cpufreq driver?) could simply always assume that DFLL
were available.

Aside from the no-sign-compare issue (which I assume is being fixed in
parallel before this is applied?) is there really a need to second-guess
the kernel's -W flags?

It'd be best not to put filenames in comments; it's just one more thing
to update if the file gets renamed.

I don't think you need a copy of these; just read the globals directly?

Why not:

	return td->mode == DFLL_OPEN_LOOP;

or at least:

	return td->mode != DFLL_DISABLED &&
		td->mode != DFLL_UNINITIALIZED;

Do we really need a (private, single-use) function just to write a field
in a structure?

Does the compiler really need to be told about pure? It seems pretty
obvious from the code, and I imagine the compiler is smart enough to
tell. It looks like __pure would be preferred:

include/linux/compiler-gcc.h:94:#define __pure __attribute__((pure))

if (!dfll_is_running(td))
	return 0;

Doesn't clk_get_rate() work before clk_enable() (which happens in
pm_runtime_get_sync()), so you could simplify the error-handling here by
checking the rate a little earlier, outside the pm_runtime_get/put?

Would plain pm_runtime_put() work just as well, and avoid the put if
something else enables the driver/dfll clock very soon after?

Does a root clock actually have any parents?

Hmm. Seems like we need a patch to the clkdev core before this series?

Use dfll_is_running()? Given td->mode embodies both enable/disable and
the current mode, would it make more sense to have a debugfs file that
exposed the raw enum, so you could both tell is-enabled and the current
mode?

Missing blank line.

This is going to allow unbalanced prepare_enable/disable_unprepare calls
simply by writing stuff to the debugfs file. Do we want to make debugfs
more friendly than that? If so, perhaps keep some state around to
indicate the last requested state from debugfs, and only make the clock
calls if the new requested state is different from the previous
debugfs-requested state, rather than different to the current-actual state?

regmap will give you this function for free. Perhaps its considered too
much overhead though?

Don't you need to check whether ppos==0, to detect continuation rather
than initial writes?

For register twiddling, why not just use a user-space app that mmap()s
/dev/mem and blasts in the values? That would remove the need to put
this into the kernel. This also feels like a function that should be
implemented as a common utility, not open-coded into every driver. regmap?

Isn't td->mode always == DFLL_UNINITIALIZED when this function is
called, since the mode is only set when dfll_enable() is called, which
is only called when dfll_clk_enable() is called, and the clock isn't
enabled when this function is called?

devm_kzalloc would simplify error-handling.

Why not just store the pointer?

devm_ioremap()

I evidently should have mentioned devm_clk_get() somewhere too.

What is that matching? dfll_init() does a matched get/put, as do
dfll_enable/disable, which in turn should be called in a matched fashion
from any client's clk_enable/disable.

Remove filename?
