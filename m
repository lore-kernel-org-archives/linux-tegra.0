I'm not a fan of the added argument. Since it's really just a check
whether you are running on a device-tree probed machine or not, adding
a machine_is_{harmony,paz00,seaboard}() check in the same place as the
!is_dt check now will accomplish the same thing.

It would be nice to check for of_machine_is_compatible() instead of the
machine_is_.*() tests, but then you need to ifdef it since it doesn't
evaluate to 0 on CONFIG_OF=n -- for extra bonus, do it that way and add
the empty of_machine_is_compatible() function to include/linux/of.h.
