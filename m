Here is one example: in shmem_unuse() in mm/shmem.c, list_for_each_entry_safe()
is used. In this case, the caller releases shmem_swaplist_lock inside the loop.
During that window, the list may be modified, and the previously saved next may
become stale. Therefore, next needs to be recomputed so that subsequent iteration
is based on the latest list state.

This leads to two possible approaches:

1. Change list_for_each_entry_safe(pos, n, head, member) directly to
list_for_each_entry_safe(pos, head, member). If we do this, the case
above would need to be converted to an open-coded form.

2. Support both forms, list_for_each_entry_safe(pos, n, head, member)
and list_for_each_entry_safe(pos, head, member), as described in the
link below.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/9b98e860-11df-44bf-9a95-3046d2c274a6@linux.dev/

Do you have any other thoughts on this?
