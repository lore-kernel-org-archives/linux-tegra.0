=46air enough. Can you please review and comment on v7 of the series? W=

can discuss at KS as well.

So you will need to create devices, defer their probing and then probe
on demand as well unless you have other ideas how you would do it.

I would think that the equivalent function for ACPI to of_device_probe
could process these if they are generic and you can associate the
dependency to a struct device.

My understanding was with deferred probe that it also solves suspend
ordering problems because things are suspended in reverse order of
probing. I suppose you could have slightly different dependencies for
suspend, runtime PM, etc. than for probe? Perhaps we need to save the
list of dependencies as we probe them. I don't think that would be too
hard to add on to this series, but then if we don't need it now, why
add it?

DT is first. I think both examples could use this. Board files avoid
the problem by controlling the registration order with initcall levels
and just the call order in the code. You could come up with some way
to define dependencies for devices in board files and reuse this
mechanism. ACPI could use this as well if the dependencies are handled
in a similar way and it seems like they could be.

Okay, I should have grepped for that:
drivers/base/platform.c:                ACPI_COMPANION_SET(&pdev->dev, =
NULL);
drivers/base/platform.c:        len =3D acpi_device_modalias(dev, buf,
PAGE_SIZE -1);
drivers/base/platform.c:        rc =3D acpi_device_uevent_modalias(dev,=
 env);
drivers/base/platform.c:        /* Then try ACPI style match */
drivers/base/platform.c:        if (acpi_driver_match_device(dev, drv))

These are all cases which have DT version as well, so we're not really
all that different here. There's a few more for DT, but that probably
means you have just not hit the problems we have yet. For example,
what happens if you have an interrupt line in which the controller is
probed after the device connected to the interrupt line? That required
resolving irqs in platform_get_irq rather than using static resources
to support deferred probe.

Converting things like this to fwnode calls isn't hard to do. There
just hasn't been a pressing need or mandate to do so.
