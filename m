Humm... But this patch deals with the i/o space and it is failing below
on the memory space.

Arnd and I discussed io_offset some. I don't think either of us can
figure out when it should be anything but 0 at least if pci i/o bus
addresses start at 0.

I don't think mem_offset is the issue. I think perhaps you need to set
pcibios_min_mem to the memory window base (0xa0000000), but that's just
a guess.
