ok.. Which means, all platforms need to have a proper DT that describes
the correct amount of sensors.

There is a very common way of solving this, you can pass .data and grab
after calling of_node_match(), just like the tegra soc thermal driver
already does.

Well, if the patch is needed to add support for different versions of
your sensor block, then there is no reason why not patching.

It is not good to ignore. The correct thing to do here is for tegra to
have correct DT entries for each sensor block version, to correctly
represent the amount of sensors present in the RTL, then you reflect
that in device driver using compatible. This way you wont need to ignore
failures, and you will support the correct amount of sensors for each
block version.

I am not sure that is a good example to follow.
