Consider the following sequence:

1. Something other than keyboard generates wakeup event
2. It's IRQ fires up and gets serviced
3. System starts resuming devices
4. User presses a key on the keypad while it is still suspended _and_
   registered as a wakeup source
5. Keypad's ISR runs as well and you decide that KEY_POWER should be
   reported even though keypad wasn't the real reason the system
   woke up.

Is this scenario not possible?

Thanks.
