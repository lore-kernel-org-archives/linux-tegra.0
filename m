No it does not work with #address-cells = <1> with the current
structure that we have.

With #address-cells = <2>, we can state that this device is on
chip-select 4 and on this specific offset of chip-select 4 (that is
the second address cell). I do not see how we can specify this with
only one address cell.

And is it really that odd? Looking at other drivers they all use the
same metod, even the arm,pl172 that you where referring to as a base
for our implementation.
