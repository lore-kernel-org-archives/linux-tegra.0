I'll do that.

I'm in the middle of travel right now and speaking at a conference tomo=
rrow,
so I may not be able to get to that for a couple of days, but will do m=
y best
to do it as soon as I possibly can.

Well, something along these lines probably.

As Alan said, there are two problems here.  First off, the ordering of =
the
list used by system suspend/resume is the registration ordering, not th=
e
probe ordering.  Moreover, though, even if we get the ordering right, i=
t
still is not sufficient for devices with async_suspend set.

To address this, the core will have to make the involved async threads =
wait
for each other in accordance with the dependencies too.  That, in turn,=
 is
very close to what's needed for runtime PM.

We don't have this particular problem, because the IRQ controllers are
enumerated in a special way.

Well, to me the problem is actually generic, so it is better to use gen=
eric
concepts to start with when trying to address it where that doesn't add=
 too
much overhead.  Otherwise it's very easy to lose the broader context fr=
om
one's sight and then to start cutting corners.
