(Resending, and revising - the original wasn't fully baked in several 
regards..)

Hello Stephen,

thanks for your review.

It's worth noting that the clock binding documentation itself refers to 
pairs:

----

clocks:		List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair
 		for each clock input to the device.  Note: if the
 		clock provider specifies '0' for #clock-cells, then
 		only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt#n50

But given the ambiguity of that documentation, I basically agree, so have 
changed it to:

- clocks : Must contain an array of clock specifiers, one per clock.
            DFLL source clocks.  At minimum this should include the
            reference clock source and the IP block's main clock
            source.  Also it should contain the DFLL's I2C controller
            clock source.  The format is <&clock-provider-phandle
            clock-id>.

Hmm.  Referring to the DT clock binding documentation, it lists the 
'clock-names' property as optional, and the 'clocks' property as 
mandatory:

-----

==Clock consumers==

Required properties:
clocks:		List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair
 		for each clock input to the device.  Note: if the
 		clock provider specifies '0' for #clock-cells, then
 		only the phandle portion of the pair will appear.

Optional properties:
clock-names:	List of clock input name strings sorted in the same
 		order as the clocks property.  Consumers drivers
 		will use clock-names to match clock input names
 		with clocks specifiers.

Considering that of_clk_get() doesn't require names, the situation appears 
to be the way that the original patch described it (modulo the part about 
"two cells.")

I've altered the 'clock-names' format along the lines of what you've 
suggested, but have not changed the 'clocks' format, per the above 
discussion:

-----

- clocks : Must contain an array of clock specifiers, one per clock.
            DFLL source clocks.  At minimum this should include the
            reference clock source and the IP block's main clock
            source.  Also it should contain the DFLL's I2C controller
            clock source.  The format is <&clock-provider-phandle
            clock-id>.

- clock-names : Must contain an array of strings, one per 'clocks'
                 cell.  The position in the array of these strings must
                 correspond to the position in the 'clocks' array (see
                 above).
   - soc
   - ref
   - i2c

That's fine.  Removed.

Hehe.  Removed.
