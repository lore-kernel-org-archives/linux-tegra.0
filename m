I understand the logic behind handling powering sequences in the device 
driver, but as we discussed for some classes of devices this might just not 
scale. I don't know how many different panels (each with different powering 
sequences) are relying on pwm_backlight, but the alternative of embedding 
support for all of them into the kernel (and bloating the kernel image) or 
having a 3 kilometers list in the kernel configuration to individually chose 
which panel to support (which would be cumbersome and make the kernel less 
portable across boards) does not look much appealing to me. With power 
sequences encoded in the DT, we could have one .dtsi file per panel that would 
be included from the board's .dts file - no bloat, no drivers explosion, 
portability preserved.

DT support is actually the main point of power sequences, as outside of the DT 
we can always work the old way and use callbacks. If we were to remove DT 
support, I am not sure this work would still be worth being merged.

Alex.
