Are there any objections to my taking both patches through the Tegra
tree? Patch 2/2 depends on 1/2 and is Tegra-specific. This should work
out fine unless anyone else wants to use the new header this kernel
cycle; if they do, this should go into a topic branch in the DT tree
that I can pull into the Tegra tree.
