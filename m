Is it failing because of this particular commit?  That is, does
reverting the entire commit help?

It won't be, because you use stateless links.

Well, if it breaks, then there is a bug somewhere.  I'm not seeing it
now, but let's dig into this.

Since you don't pass DL_FLAG_RPM_ACTIVE to device_link_add(), the
changes related to that don't matter.

The links are not there before your probe function runs.  It adds the
links and then pm_runtime_put_suppliers() sees them, but since
link->rpm_active is one for the new links, it won't do anything with
them.

Well, there is a difference, but if it matters, then something fishy
is going on IMO.  Before this change pm_runtime_put_suppliers() would
do pm_runtime_put() on the new links' suppliers and (because their
PM-runtime usage counters are both one at that point) it will actually
try to suspend the suppliers.  It should be easy enough to verify if
this really matters, stay tuned.
