I had explained why I fixed this here.
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/2832646/

By checking the PMU_INT signal in the schematic of Dalmore, it only
supports active low. It was connected to !PWR_INT of Tegra114 that will
cause the system wake up automatically when syspended to LP0 if active
high.

That's why my change is setting the IRQ type of PMIC to active low and
keep the "nvidia,invert-interrupt". And it can make the LP0/1/2 work
proper.

So this patch will make the PMIC not working on Dalmore and break the 
suspend function.
