This really should be revisted.  That was in the context of full
system suspend, but we're now in a world of runtime suspend which
absolutely does need dependency tracking or reference counting to get
the ordering right.

Yes, I'll send you my current patch for you to look at.  One of the
engineers from Linaro is going to be pushing that patch set forward.
However, I don't know if it helps with this problem because I believe
that the suspend order is based on the implicit probe order of
devices, but my patch allows drivers to cause the probe order to get
rearranged at runtime.  I don't believe there is a global list showing
the order that devices successfully got probed, but I may be wrong
here.
