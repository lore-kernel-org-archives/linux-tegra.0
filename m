Did you look at what might be involved to extend struct device to hace a
list of pm_domains?  Like Ulf, I'm a bit unsettled by this
implementation that has to work around the basic limitation in the
driver model.

Having devices in multitple domains is needed for SoCs I'm familiar with
also, so is a needed feature.

I think removing the struct device limitation and corresponding
assumptions in the driver and PM core is a prerequisite for this
feature.

Doing that will lead to several questions about how to handle runtime PM
operations (e.g. which of the multiple PM domains should the one to call
the drivers runtime PM hooks when a device changes runtime PM state?)

Anyways, even with the potential complexities, I think attempting this
is the right way forward.
