Hi Thierry,

I just recall I still need at least "nvidia,cpu-pwr-good-time" and
"nvidia,cpu-pwr-off-time" two properties to make CPU idle power-down
mode (same with LP2) work normally after this series.

So can you provide me that or point me out where is your downstream
kernel source? There data would be come from DT after this series.

Thanks,
Joseph
