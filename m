I've always considered per-SoC invariant data to not belong into
bindings. That is, constants such as power partition IDs or SMMU client
IDs should be defined via tables in drivers, and DT should be used to
hook them up to devices.

Defining the existing power domains in DT seems rather brittle to me. A
compatible string would imply the set of supported power domains anyway
and having that set specified in DT would technically require us to add
code in the driver to validate that the DT is sane, which would entail
the addition of a very similar table anyway.

One further reason why I prefer not to have these things specified (as
opposed to "glued" together) in DT is that the DT is ABI, so if we ever
happen to ship a broken DT we won't be able to easily fix it. Driver
code, on the other hand, can always easily be fixed.
