We would end up merging the patches into -next at the same time, so there
is not much point in queuing them via Tegra if they go via the PCI tree
eventually; we should not add to -next patches that are not ready to
be merged anyway.

I need your help (ACKs) though to queue them up - I review the patches
but I can neither test them nor get access to HW TRMs so for some of them
there is not much I can do.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
