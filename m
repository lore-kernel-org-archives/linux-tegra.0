The panel GPIO goes to the panel hardware device, and enables the panel?
And similarly for the PWM GPIO, it goes to the PWM hardware device? Just
making sure there are no other components involved.

We have panel drivers for omap in drivers/video/omap2/displays/. I'm not
sure if other platforms have their own versions of panel drivers, but
probably adding a simple panel driver system for a platform would not be
too difficult. It could even be quite hardcoded, i.e. embedded directly
into the display subsystem driver, just to get something working until
the common panel framework is available.

Yes, I agree it's not good idea to add more platform specific panel
drivers. But it's unclear when CPF will be merged, so if you need to get
the panel working now, I don't see a simple ad-hoc driver as too
horrible. But, of course, I'm not the one making the decision whether to
merge or not =3D).

Right. Note that I didn't present omap panel drivers as perfect

Yes, for most panels with just one native mode and nothing else, the
panel driver can contain the timings.

However, this subject has been discussed earlier a few times. If the
panel in question doesn't need any special power-on/off sequences, just,
perhaps, one gpio or such, we could still use DT video modes. This would
simplify the cases where you have lots of different very simple panels.

Obviously the same questions apply to DT video modes than to the power
sequences, and while I do think it's better to handle the timings inside
the driver, I'm not too much against video timings in DT. The reason
being that the video modes are quite clear, simple and stable data,
versus the much more complex and open-ended power sequences.

Don't look at the mainline omap panel drivers, at least not too closely
=3D). They contain hackery that will be cleaned up with CPF.

I think there are two methods to implements simple panel drivers:

The hardcoded one, where the display subsystem driver manages a few
different panel models. This is obviously not very expandable or
"correct", but should probably work just fine for a few models, until
CPF is usable.

Something like CPF will have: have the panel device/driver as a platform
device/driver, which will register itself to the display subsystem. And
with "itself" I mean some kind of struct panel_entity, with a few ops
implemented by the panel driver.

Well, this goes a bit out of subject. If you want to discuss panel
drivers more, please start a new thread. Laurent's upcoming CPF v2
should give you good ideas what the model will be.
