Indeed. The SOCs, Arch's which does support low power
state independently and doesn't need any co-ordination between CPU's
will continue to work same way as before with this series.

Apart from shared peripherals which Colin pointed out, OMAP also
brings in the security software state which is kind of executing in
parallel with linux. This state is lost in certain deeper low power
states and since the security software is affine to only master CPU
(because of OMAP security architecture), the co-ordination is
mandatory to achieve those low power states.

So this additional CPU co-ordination logic for such C-states
really helps to solve the issue in most generic way.
