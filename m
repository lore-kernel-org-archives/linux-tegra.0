Seen that, thanks! After seeing your comments I come to thing that
maybe we should merge ACTMON support first and then adapt it to use
watermarking afterwards. I'm all for incremental changes and after 4
iterations this series should be close to completion now - would be
sad to go back to the design board at this stage.

Reviewing your v4 is on my schedule for tomorrow, thanks for your patience!
