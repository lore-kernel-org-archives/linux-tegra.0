The Tegra210 AGIC interrupt controller is a 2nd level interrupt controller
located in a separate power domain to the main GIC interrupt controller.
It can route interrupts to the main CPU cluster or an Audio DSP slave.
This series only support routing interrupts to the main CPU cluster.

Ideally we would like to re-use the existing ARM GIC driver because the
AGIC is a GIC-400. However, in order to do so this requires adding
runtime power management support for irqchips and several significant
changes to the exisiting GIC driver for power management reasons.

Originally, this series was sent out as an RFC [0] and hopefully, I have
addressed all the comments and issues reported. I was/am tempted to
split this series into two series, one to add runtime-pm support for
irqchips (patches 1-8) and one to add support for the AGIC to the GIC
driver (patches 9-15). If this would be more manageable and easier, I
am happy to do so.

I have included a fix for OMAP (needs testing) that was reported by
Grygorii. I know it may seem odd to include in a series adding an
interrupt controller for Tegra, but oh well ...

This is work well so far on Tegra, but would love to get some more
testing on other platforms.
