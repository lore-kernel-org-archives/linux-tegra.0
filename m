It is common for SD/MMC host controllers to set the parent clock that
drives the SD/MMC interface in order to support various operating
speeds. Typically, this is performed by calling common clock framework
APIs such as clk_set_rate(). The problem is that these APIs may sleep
and must not be called from within atomic sections and therefore, these
functions cannot be called within the existing 'set_clock' SDHCI
operator because they are called from within the context of a spinlock.
Add a new 'set_parent_clock' operator for the SDHCI driver that is
called early during the SDHCI 'set_ios' before the spinlock is aquire to
give the platform driver the opportunity to set the parent clock rate.

Please note that, unfortunately, the Tegra and MSM SDHCI drivers
currently appear to mis-use the 'set_clock' operator by calling
clk_set_rate(). In the case of Tegra, occasionally but not always,
'scheduling while atomic' errors are reported (so most of the time we
are getting lucky). In the of the MSM SDHCI driver, it is releasing and
re-acquiring the spinlock which is bad.

I have not attempted to fix the MSM driver in this seris, but I am
copying hopefully, the right people to fix it.
