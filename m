Ignoring the issues with oops in reboot, I think there's a bug in that
when hotplug is enabled, smp_kill_cpus() calls platform_cpu_kill(), but
nothing causes the failing CPU to ever execute smp_ops.cpu_die(). Hence,
if the implementation of smp_ops.cpu_kill() relies on the target CPU
having run smp_ops.cpu_die(), then smp_ops.cpu_kill() may not operate
correctly.

Or, must smp_ops.cpu_kill() not assume that smp_ops.cpu_die() will be
called on the target CPU? What are the semantics here? Will mentioned
that __cpu_die and cpu_die are a pair, but what about is the smp_ops are
used directly; are they also supposed to be a pair?

The change below solves the pairing issue, by making ipi_cpu_stop()
perform the low-level part of hotplug that matches what smp_kill_cpus()
call to platform_cpu_kill(). This certainly fixes the
hang-in-reboot-or-shutdown problem on Tegra.

Some things I'm not sure of here:

* cpu_die() calls idle_task_exit(). That's probably wrong if it's
triggered from an IPI; who knows what task it's executing. That said, if
migrate_to_reboot_cpu() did set_cpus_allowed_ptr(current,
cpumask_of(cpu)), perhaps that guarantees the CPU is running the idle
task since there's nothing else that could be running?

* ipi_cpu_stop() currently calls local_fiq_disable(), but cpu_die()
doesn't. Should both functions call both local_fiq_disable() and
local_irq_disable()?

* Perhaps smp_kill_cpus() should also be changed, to call cpu_die() not
platform_cpu_kill(), to keep the pairing correct at that level too.

Plus, I ignored any issues you raised for the oops case on reboot...
