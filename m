Thanks!  I read too much into what was being improved.

So this patch series, which on other merits may be a good idea, is as
a by product solving a specific ordering issue, moving successful panel
initialization to an earlier point in the boot sequence, if I now
understand more correctly.

In that context, this seems like yet another ad hoc way of causing the
probe order to change in a way to solves one specific issue?  Could
it just as likely move the boot order of some other driver on some
other board later, to the detriment of somebody else?
