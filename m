Yes, we have some missing entry and I responded into other mail thread. 
I will post the diff here to complete.

I2C6 pinmux is not in this controller, it is dpaux controller and we 
have not supported this. This require little bit different handling. I 
have already downstream bug for support this. Will add you in loop so 
that single fix can work for mainline and downstream.

Other than I2C6, some other mux are missing.

Fine.
Should I sent the diff or full change? I think full change as this need 
to go on pincontrol subsystem, not in Tegra.
