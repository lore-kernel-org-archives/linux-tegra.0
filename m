I agree, I think that that would give us the most flexibility to handle
whatever scenario. However, I was thinking that we could still use the
genpd core to register pm-domains with and control. My thought was to
allow devices to have a bindings with multiple pm-domains ...

	dev-xyz {
		...
		power-domains = <&domain-a>, <&domain-b>;
	};

Then in the genpd core we do having something like ...

diff --git a/drivers/base/power/domain.c b/drivers/base/power/domain.c
index e697dec9d25b..d1ae6ddf4903 100644
--- a/drivers/base/power/domain.c
+++ b/drivers/base/power/domain.c
@@ -2026,6 +2026,15 @@ int genpd_dev_pm_attach(struct device *dev)

                if (!pd_args.np)
                        return -ENOENT;

+               dev_dbg(dev, "cannot add PM domains, %d detected!\n", ret);
+               return 0;
        }

Then add some new public APIs for getting and controlling the pm-domains ...

struct generic_pm_domain *pm_genpd_get(struct device *dev, char *name);
- Use 'dev->of_node' to look-up pm-domain if populated, else uses name.

struct generic_pm_domain *of_pm_genpd_get(struct device *dev, int index);
void pm_genpd_put(struct generic_pm_domain *pd);
int pm_genpd_power_on(struct generic_pm_domain *pd);
int pm_genpd_power_off(struct generic_pm_domain *pd);
- Power on/off APIs would be synchronous types

Are there any potential pitfalls of the above?

Cheers
Jon
