I'm referring to Xavier_TRM_Public.pdf in that location. If you look at
page 4422, "Shared Interrupts Configuration", the example has aggregated
EMPTY and FULL interrupts on shared interrupts 0 and 1, respectively. I
guess it being an example doesn't make it strictly a recommendation, but
I wonder if we should avoid giving examples that use mappings which we
discourage.

Virtualization isn't something that we're very concerned about upstream,
but I'll take that under consideration.

Right, that makes sense. But within that IE register it can consider all
bits fair game, right? One thing I wonder, though, is whether there
should be some external mechanism to set the shared interrupt to use. If
we go purely by convention we'll eventually get this wrong. So currently
we list all available interrupts in DT and then we could pick just the
first. But what if somebody else already picked the first and "owns" it?

I'm not sure we have any practical mechanism to rewrite the DTB, but
perhaps something to keep in mind if ever we need to support other
entities down the road.

Currently we encode the shared mailboxes in DT like this:

	mboxes =3D <&hsp_top0 TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM 0>,
		 <&hsp_aon TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM 1>;
	mbox-names =3D "rx", "tx";

I suppose we could change that to something like:

	mboxes =3D <&hsp_top0 TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM (0 << 31 | 0)>,
		 <&hsp_aon TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM (1 << 31 | 0)>;

Where the MSB of the mailbox index would indicate the direction. We
could maybe add some eye-candy to make it easier to read:

	mboxes =3D <&hsp_top0 TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_SM_RX(0)>,
		 <&hsp_aon TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_TYPE_SM TEGRA_HSP_MBOX_SM_TX(1)>;

That said, I wonder if perhaps it is safe to treat all mailboxes as
consumers by default and omit and direction in DT. If a mailbox is used
as consumer, then the CCPLEX is only interested in FULL interrupts, so
we enable those. The entity that shares the mailbox will write data to
it and is only interested in the EMPTY interrupt, which we don't touch
=66rom the CCPLEX.

For mailboxes that the CCPLEX writes to, we can reconfigure them as
producers by disabling the FULL interrupt and enabling the EMPTY
interrupt instead. We can do that the first time somebody calls the
mbox_send_message() on the mailbox.

Do you see any problems with that approach?

Do the per-mailbox IE registers act as a second level enable, then? The
HSP driver would still have to set the IE register to aggregate FULL and
EMPTY interrupts as needed, but could then use the per-mailbox IE
registers to actually enable and disable (that is, unmask and mask) the
interrupts?

Okay, that seems like it would somewhat complicate things and we don't
really support VM uses yet, so I think it best to leave that out for
now.
