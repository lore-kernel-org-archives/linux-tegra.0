But as no one has actually produced a bootlog, how do you know that?
Where exactly is your time being spent?  What driver is causing long
delays?  Why is the long-delay-drivers not being done in their own
thread?  And most importantly, why are you ignoring the work that people
did back in 2008 to solve the issue on other hardware platforms?

No I'm not, I'm asking for real data, not hand-wavy-this-is-going-to
solve-the-random-issue-i'm-having type patch by putting random calls in
semi-random subsystems all over the kernel.

And when I ask for real data, you respond with the fact that you aren't
trying to speed up boot time here at all, so what am I supposed to think
other than that you don't care enough to do the real work and are trying
to hack the driver core up instead.

No apologies needed, it's cathartic at times :)
