This looks very nice. There is one related aspect that I have been
grumbling about for a while, but I don't know what the driver is
actually supposed to do there:

For the IORESOURCE_IO resources, some drivers request the MMIO address
that the window is mapped into, some drivers request the PIO range, and
some of them request both. I also believe the resource that gets put
into the bridge resources list is not always the same one (or maybe
that got fixed by now).

What do you think is the correct behavior here, should the driver only
request the PIO range with parent=ioport_resource, or should it also
request the MMIO window for the I/O ports with parent=iomem_resource?
In the latter case, any idea how that can be generalized?

Another aspect is that we already have the
gen_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges() function that does the same as your
new devm_request_pci_bus_resources() and then a few other things. I
have been wondering whether we could move that function into common
code convert drivers to use that wherever possible, but I guess we can
always do that as a follow-up after this series.
