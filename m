Right, should be ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ, thanks for catching this.

How do we get subset of a string and making sure it is the last? There 
must be some assumptions here (though they will possibly be true) I 
guess, for example, they should be in the order $board, $soc... and the 
last "nvidia" should be the start of the last compatible id we would 
like to get.

Ah yeah, thanks.

devinfo is used to provide dev info to create platform device structure, 
so I think it is OK here.

OK, thanks.

I should add back those clk_put here.

Thanks for catching.
