When system suspend to LP1, most of the PLLs was clock gated. Because we
didn't cut off the core power, the settings of PLL still keep there. But
we switch the clock source of CPU to CLK_M before shut off PLLs by
CCLKG_BURSY_POLICY register. So we need to resume it back to original
clock source by CCLKG_BURST_POLICY register. Or it would be keep in low
rate (CLK_M) after resume.

For Tegra20/30, the same code had been implemented in the suspend/resume
function of tegra_cpu_car_ops. It restores the CPU clock ASAP when CPU
resume from a suspend state to get quick performance I believe.

For Tegra114, the resume performance is cool (although we can't see it
in upstream kernel now, it still need some other functions.). We can
implement all the clock related suspend/resume function in the clock
driver.
