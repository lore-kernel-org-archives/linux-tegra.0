Thanks for your comments.
I thought about it carefully again, and found we doesn't need to change
any codes for this issue.
In the DT, actually the node "thermal-zones{} already describes the
correct sensors, so we doesn't need to add more changes in DT.

Yes, for the driver, we just need to add a new file, something like
tegra210-soctherm.c, to configure a new platform, which can remove the
configuration for the disabled sensor, so that the soctherm driver will
not try to register that sensors anymore.

Since in current released platforms, they support all 4 sensors, so I
will not send new patches by now.

So please ignore this change.
And will you take other 3 changes?


Thanks.
