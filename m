That should really be a separate patch that goes through the devicetree
branch. But I guess it's fairly trivial, so it's not a big deal.

Since I have an Atmel flash on my board, I see:

[    1.282958] m25p80 spi32766.1: found at25df321a, expected w25q32
[    1.289103] m25p80 spi32766.1: at25df321a (4096 Kbytes)

Is there any way around that (the first log line above)?

I suppose the answer is that the DT should reflect the exact flash
device that's on the board, and perhaps the bootloader should be
adjusting the DT to reflect the correct value. That's probably complex.

Do you have any idea whether Atmel or Winbond flash is more common, so
we can at least minimize the number of times this message appears?
