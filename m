So it turns out that while of_read_number() can actually read any number
of cells, only the two least significant are kept because it returns a
u64. Since of_bus_default_map() uses of_read_number() the addresses
<0 0 0> and <1 0 0> are in fact the same. I'm not sure how best to solve
this. I'm not aware of a 128 bit integer type in the kernel, so I guess
the better alternative would be to fix of_bus_default_map() to cope with
#address-cells > 2 properly.
