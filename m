parts of the previous serie (sorry when I tried to reduce the CC list,
I forgot you)

>     Before this patch tps65910 was broken due to missing backward compatibility
>     with "vendor,system-power-controller". As the old helper uses the new one,
>     it works again.
>
>   - act8865 and tps65910 are ported to the new helper function
>
>   - The last commit removes the olf helper which was only used for source compatibility
