Should be "&&" here.
Because we need to check if there are still multi CPUs online, then we
need to make sure all the secondary CPUs be power gated first. After all
the secondary CPUs been power gated, the CPU0 could go into LP2 and the
CPU rail could be shut off.
If all the secondary CPUs been hot plugged, then the "num_online_cpus()
>1" would be always false. Then the CPU0 can go into LP2 directly.

So it was used to check are there multi cpus online or not? It's
difference with the last_cpu check below. The last_cpu was used to check
all the CPUs were in LP2 process or not. If the CPU0 is the last one
went into LP2 process, then it would be true.

So the point here is. We can avoid to check the power status of the
secodarys CPUs if they be unplugged.

It may look like the coupled cpuidle can satisfy the usage here. But it
didn't. Please check the criteria of coupled cpuidle. 

/*
 * To use coupled cpuidle states, a cpuidle driver must:
 *
 *    Set struct cpuidle_device.coupled_cpus to the mask of all
 *    coupled cpus, usually the same as cpu_possible_mask if all cpus
 *    are part of the same cluster.  The coupled_cpus mask must be
 *    set in the struct cpuidle_device for each cpu.
 *
 *    Set struct cpuidle_device.safe_state to a state that is not a
 *    coupled state.  This is usually WFI.
 *
 *    Set CPUIDLE_FLAG_COUPLED in struct cpuidle_state.flags for each
 *    state that affects multiple cpus.
 *
 *    Provide a struct cpuidle_state.enter function for each state
 *    that affects multiple cpus.  This function is guaranteed to be
 *    called on all cpus at approximately the same time.  The driver
 *    should ensure that the cpus all abort together if any cpu tries
 *    to abort once the function is called.  The function should return
 *    with interrupts still disabled.
 */

The Tegra30 can support the secondary CPUs go into LP2 (power-gate)
independently. The limitation of the CPU0 is the CPU0 must be the last
one to go into LP2 to shut off CPU rail.

It also no need for every CPU to leave LP2 at the same time. The CPU0
would be always the first one that woken up from LP2. But all the other
secondary CPUs can still keep in LP2. One of the secondary CPUs can also
be woken up alone, if the CPU0 already up.

It just because the "pclk" is not available on the Tegra30's clock
framework but Tegra20 right now.
