Yes.

So, one thing still concerns me is that the binding and driver still 
can't work with multiple HSP sub-modules per HSP block. It only supports 
one HSP module per HSP block right how. Although, I said it matches the 
model that we are using in the downstream kernel. But I still concern if 
we need to enable and work with multiple HSP modules per HSP block at 
sometime in future, then the binding and driver need lots of change to 
achieve that. And the binding is not back-ward compatible obviously.

So I want to revise it again.

#mbox-cells: should be 2.

The mobxes property in the client node should contain the phandle of the 
HSP block, HSP sub-module ID and the specifier of the module.

Ex.
hsp_top0: hsp@1000 {
     ...
     #mbox-cells = <2>;
};

clientA {
     ....
     mboxes = <&hsp_top0 HSP_DOORBELL DB_MASTER_XXX>;
};

clientB {
     ...
     mboxes = <&hsp_top0 HSP_SHARED_MAILBOX SM_MASTER_XXX>;
};

Stephen, How do you think of this change?

Thanks,
-Joseph
