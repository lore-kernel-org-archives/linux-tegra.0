As I said before the DMA API is not a good fit for graphics drivers.
Most of the DMA buffers used by graphics cores are long lived and big,
so we need a special pool to alloc from to avoid eating all contiguous
address space, as DMA API does not provide shrinker callbacks for
clients using large amount of memory.

If we go with CMA, this is a non-issue, as CMA allows to use the contig
area for normal allocations and only purges them if it really needs the
space for contig allocs.
