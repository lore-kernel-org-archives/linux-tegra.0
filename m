I also don't know. I prefer compal for paz00 because Toshiba's code name was 
procyon (I think) and I don't want to change all the naming. Also Toshiba 
showed no interest in helping us, so I don't see why they should get the fame.

I just copy-pasted from harmony, I guess it doesn't matter.

no, 80000 is even ;-) Seriously, it just reflects the fact that the embedded 
controller bus runs at 80kHz. Even more seriously, reading "booting-without-
of.txt" in the Documentation/devicetree dir,

      | o PowerPC,970@0
      |   |- name = "PowerPC,970"
      |   |- device_type = "cpu"
      |   |- reg = <0>
      |   |- clock-frequency = <5f5e1000>
      |   |- 64-bit
      |   |- linux,phandle = <2>

 it looks like all clock-frequency values are hexadecimal. In this case even 
<400000> would be wrong (or the docu is --- ok, the docu is wrong).
