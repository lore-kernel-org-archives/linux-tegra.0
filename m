Heh, what you are describing is the v1 of this series :)

As you probably noticed, the issue is that on Tegra we want to use 
tegra_powergate_sequence_power_up to enable the SATA power rail. That 
function assumes that it gets a disabled clock and returns with the 
clock enabled. If we use ahci_platform's resource management functions,
this is not doable, since it wants to handle clocks by itself.

To be honest, I too would prefer handling the resources in the driver. 
The driver needs other resources than what ahci_platform currently 
manages (at least reset_controls and multiple regulators, later we might 
get more) and managing them in the driver allows the driver to do proper 
error handling and manage all resources consistently and in one place. 
Also, I don't think it is sensible to add support for loading every 
possible kind of DT resource to ahci_platform, since most drivers won't 
need them. Other subsystems I've been in don't have this kind of helper 
library, so diverging here seems weird.

That said, if you feel strongly about this, I can do what you described.

Thanks,
Mikko
