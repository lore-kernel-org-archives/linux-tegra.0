So of_platform_populate() is called at arch_initcall_sync() level on
arm64. This allows at least two levels of probing separation before
(e.g. drivers registered as arch_initcall) and after (device_initcall).
If you register a driver earlier than arch_initcall_sync (see for
example vexpress_osc_init), it will get probed when the platform devices
are populated. Any later device_initcalls will get probed when the
corresponding drivers are registered. If you need ordering between
device_initcalls, I would recommend deferred probing.

The tricky part is if you need more drivers to be initialised at
arch_initcall_sync() in a specific order. Here it looks like the node
ordering in DT has an effect on probing. I don't say the DT should list
them in the order they should be probed but maybe we can improve the
model and do some sorting during unflattening (as I suggested in my
reply to Olof). In the meantime, for vexpress we worked around it by
explicitly checking the compatible node during a pre-arch_initcall.

Do you mean ARMv7 vs ARMv8 CPUs?

We've done this with vexpress thanks to Pawel. As he said, the difficult
part was converting the existing code to the Linux device model. The
32-bit v2m_dt_init() function simply calls of_platform_populate(). If
you don't have a machine_desc at all, this would be the default (see
customize_machine()). If you use PSCI, there is no need for SoC specific
smp_ops either. So you basically get the same code base with no
additional arch/arm/mach-* machine_desc.

Looking at the tegra_init_early(), I think for arm64 as
pre-arch_initcall_sync you would only need:

	tegra_init_fuse();
	tegra_powergate_init();

(I'm not sure about trusted foundations but that's a 32-bit only project
for the time being)

From tegra_dt_init() you need clocks but isn't CLK_OF_DECLARE enough?
You also have PMC code and I'm not familiar with your implementation. A
lot of the functionality could be moved to PSCI-capable firmware.
