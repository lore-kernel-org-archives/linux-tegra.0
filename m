I expect we at least need a version number in the compatible value, even
if we don't need a representation of the SoC or vendor for which the ABI
was built.

One more thought: Setting the CPU reset address isn't the only operation
that'll be performed via firmware_ops; we'd also need to e.g. disable
CPU power-gating and perhaps other things. Can that all be done at
run-time? I guess it shouldn't be hard to fix that if we can't yet.
