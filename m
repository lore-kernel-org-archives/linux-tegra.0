What I am seeing on Tegra is that the SPI controller is no longer
runtime-pm suspended and so while this may improve performance, I think
that this change is going to have a negative impact on idle power.

I would be surprised if this problem is specific to Tegra because I
don't see how the controller's busy state can ever be cleared :-(
