Does the controller HW actually work correctly in such a mode?

Obviously a fully initialized x4 controller has to correctly handle 
being attached solely to a x1 device. However, that's a different case 
to simply not initializing 3 of the 4 PHYs. It's plausible the 
controller handles this just fine, or that it hangs up or otherwise 
misbehaves if some of the PHYs aren't enabled and hence it can't even 
detect whether something is attached to them or not. Either way, adding 
your explanation into the binding would be useful to highlight the 
reason for the special case.
