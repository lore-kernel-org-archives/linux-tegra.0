There's already such a ringbuffer in the printk code. To implement what
you suggest would effectively be creating a copy of that buffer because
we'd be allocating the buffer and the console code would just dump each
and every character in the logbuf into that ring buffer without rate-
limitation.

To make matters worse, the ringbuffer would be empty most of the time
after the initial dump of the logbuf, so we'd be wasting all that buffer
space.

It just seems to me like we should be keeping the TCU driver as close as
possible to other UART drivers which also busy loop in order to rate-
limit what the console can write. Given the current mailbox framework it
is not possible to do that (in interrupt context), so an extension seems
like the most sensible option.

Perhaps you'd be less concerned about such a change if it was perhaps
more explicit? Just throwing ideas around, I think something that could
also work is if we explicitly add a mbox_flush() function that would
basically be calling ->flush(). That way users of the mailbox can make
their requirement very explicit. I haven't actually tested that, but I
think it would work. Does that sound more acceptable to you?
