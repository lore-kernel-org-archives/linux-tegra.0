I disagree.  The whole point of clock framework is to hide clock details
like tree topology behind clock API, so that we do not need every single
clock client driver to handle those details on their own.  It's
definitely desired to have clk_set_rate call handle reparenting nicely.

From what I see, if tegra clock driver can handle the dependency between
cpu_clk and emc_clk that is currently handled in cpufreq driver.  It's
likely that the generic cpufreq driver (cpufreq-cpu0) would work for
tegra.  But with this patch, the driver moves to the opposite direction.
