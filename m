Yes, and there's a pile without these defined/

What about the case where we need to turn GPIO numbers into interrupts
to pass to other drivers? In the case where we have a gpio chip that is
providing interrupt services to other drivers (such as serial chip).

Having looked at a couple of IIO drivers, it seems that the need to use
irq_to_gpio() seems to be to check if the device needs to be service. It
would be useful to see if this is due to a problem with the threadder IRQ
handler (and if so, may need fixing for the general case).
