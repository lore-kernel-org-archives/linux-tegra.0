Are you suggesting, whether runtime PM is enabled/disabled, after 
successful probe the
domain would be powered off?
For CONFIG_PM enabled case, probe() can call get_sync() and put_sync() 
can be in probe_work.
How this needs to be handled for CONFG_PM disabled case? (just calling 
clock_enable() may
not be sufficient as per previous comments)

do we really need config check here?
The debate was, whether to call hda_tegra_runtime_resume() or 
hda_tegra_enable_clocks() unconditionally here.
It would take care of both CONFIG_PM enabled/disabled cases. Then enable 
runtime PM.

I think reference here is, whether calling hda_tegra_runtime_resume() in 
probe() is
a standard procedure or not.
