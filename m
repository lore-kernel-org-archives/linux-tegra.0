Yes, that seems reasonable.

Presumably the power GPIO should be a fixed regulator though, since it
is a power control not just a plain old GPIO? That said, the current
driver apparently deals with this as a GPIO already.

The reset GPIO can separately/directly controlled by the WiFi driver
though.
