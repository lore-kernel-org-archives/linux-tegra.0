Now that I've looked at them, they are somewhat questionable failures.
They do show the fragile nature of probe ordering and the implicit
dependencies we have.

Looking at it again, they are in DT specific code already. The USB one
is in devm_usb_get_phy_by_node() which is a DT specific call.

I don't think it is one driver as the improvement is seen on multiple
platforms. I'll let Tomeu comment further on where the time was spent.

x86 did not need deferred probe either (though we probably can find
some initcall ordering hacks). This is an embedded problem, not a DT
problem.

I'm guessing the time is a matter of probing and undoing the probes
rather than slow h/w. We could maybe improve things by making sure
drivers move what they defer on to the beginning of probe, but that
seems like a horrible, fragile hack.

Yes, the only ones needing it are drivers dependent on clocks, gpio,
regulators, pwm, pin-ctrl, dma, etc. That's not a small number. This
is a side benefit and wouldn't take this series for that reason alone.

I've used the deferred probing is good enough argument myself on
previous attempts. The boot time improvements convinced me it is not
good enough except for simple cases.
