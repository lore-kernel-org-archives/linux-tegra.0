The init order of drivers has no influence at all on the ability for
companies to have their individual drivers merged upstream, please don'=
t
be so dramatic about this.

Worst case, a vendor keeps a single patch to drivers/Makefile in their
tree that reorders things, yes it will get conflicts on every release,
but really, it's trivial to maintain if they wish to keep doing this
type of thing.

Again, it is _not_ the reason that we are living with 2million+ lines o=
f
code in vendor kernels.
