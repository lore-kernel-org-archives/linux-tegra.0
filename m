Can't boot my 3.14 kernel with this change :( Most probably,
the problem is related to platform_driver_probe() usage :(
Have no time to play with it now :(, but recommend you to check also
earlyprintk, last log message I can see:
[    1.435522] bootconsole [earlycon0] disabled

But, nice try ;) Seems -EPROBE_DEFER is reality of life which
has to be accepted as is.

Ah. My measurements are not precise. I've just tracking time of message

As I've mentioned I tried TI Android Kernel 3.14 where all DRA7 SoC fea=
tures are enabled.
It is very close to production SW. LKML, by default, enables
mostly nothing and not all features are supported.=20
In my prev exercise I was able to boot till Android GUI and it has work=
ed :)

Also, cool statistic - really_probe() was called 136 times for me
(successful execution of dev->bus->probe() and drv->probe()).

Exactly. Each time new framework will be introduced or reworked (or eve=
n for some drivers),
because each of them implement its own of_get_xxx() API.=20

No. This observation comes from my working experience with OMAP4 device=
s where
lowest possible CPUIdle state was mostly equal to Device-OFF state.=20
=46ast search has allowed me to find possible source of issues in code =
- I'm pretty sure
smth. similar can be found in other ARM maches:
- arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_device.c -> omap_device_late_init().

This is actually mostly the same idea as was mentioned by Rob Clark=20
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg423485.html


=46or example, mmc1 probe will be deferred always for below DT,
but if we put evm_3v3_sw before ocp and exchange mmc1 and i2c1
- mmc1 will be probed without deferring.
Potentially, It can be done in DTC where we do not have so strict limit=
s
as for Kernel code.=20

Soc file:
/ { /* root - level 0 */
	ocp { /* simple-bus - level 1 */
		compatible =3D  "simple-bus";

		mmc1: mmc@4809c000 {
			compatible =3D "mmc";
		...
		}

		i2c1: i2c@48070000 {
			compatible =3D "i2c";
		}
	}
}

board file:
#include "SoC.dtsi"

/ {
	evm_3v3_sw: fixedregulator-evm_3v3_sw {
		compatible =3D "regulator-fixed";
		regulator-name =3D "evm_3v3_sw";
		regulator-min-microvolt =3D <3300000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt =3D <3300000>;
	};
};
