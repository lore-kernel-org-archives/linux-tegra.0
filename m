Sure I will have a look at the documentation again and sorry if I missed
anything. But in general I would expect the document to be self-explanatory
and not having to look at the driver on how it is used to understand the
firmware interface. Please make sure of that if not already.

Exactly, thanks for saving a round trip.

Sure and where do these boards get these values from ? I assume device tree ?
If so, are the fixed and can be done once at boot ?

Yes you need to add more details on that algorithm. Can firmware take random
strings as input. I guess not. Please list the valid strings and explain them.
Filter invalid strings in the driver if only handful of values are valid.

More fun, user ABI involved, so the firmware interface needs to be as clear
as possible.

It is good to capture summary of these old discussions if they are relevant.

Anything that improves and helps in understanding this is always welcome.
