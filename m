Overall I like what you're trying to do. This will enable e.g. I2C
GPIO supplying expanders to power down if none of its lines are
used for IRQs. (Read below on the suspend() case for even
better stuff we can do!)

In struct gpio_chip I just this merge window have to merge a gigantic
patch renaming this from "dev" to "parent" because we need to add
a *real* struct device dev; to gpio_chip.

So for the advent that we may in the future need a real struct device
inside irq_chip, name this .parent already today, please.

That is boiling all PM upward into the platform_device or whatever
it is containing this. But we're not just in it for runtime_pm_suspend()
and runtime_pm_resume(). We also have regular suspend() and
resume(). And ideally that should be handled by the same
callbacks.

First: what if the device contain any wakeup-flagged IRQs?
I think there is something missing here. The suspend() usecase
is not handled by this patch, but we need to think about that
here as well. I think irqchips on GPIO expanders (for example)
should be powered down on suspend() *unless* one or more of
its IRQs is flagged as wakeup, and in that case it should
*not* be powered down, instead it should just mask all
non-wakeup IRQs and restore them on resume().

Second: it's soo easy to get something wrong here. It'd be good
if the kernel was helpful. What about something like:

if (desc->irq_data.chip->dev) {
    if (desc->irq_data.chip->flags & IRQCHIP_HAS_RPM)
           retval = pm_runtime_get_sync(desc->irq_data.chip->dev)
    else if (pm_runtime_enabled(desc->irq_data.chip->dev))
           dev_warn_once(desc->irq_data.chip->dev, "irqchip not
flagged for RPM but has runtime PM enabled! weird.\n");
}

As I see it, a device that supplies an irqchip, has runtime PM but
is *NOT* setting IRQCHIP_HAS_RPM just *have* to be looked
at in detail, and deserve to have this littering its dmesg so we can
fix it. It just makes no real sense. It more sounds like a recepie for
missing interrupts otherwise.

Yours,
