Yes, DC triggers the DDC access and is the host of the DDC/I2C channel.
So I think it's reasonable to put nvidia,ddc property into the display
controller node. But the video mode info in EDID which be fetched via
DDC is the property of the panel, so this info should be provided by
panel driver. Actually display controller cares about the video modes,
not the way to get these info. So I think it's better to do the whole
work like this:

1) display controller relied on CDF to call "display_entity_get_modes"
2) panel driver calls the function which is hooked to display controller
to get the video modes via DDC.
3) if the video modes can't be fetched via DDC, panel driver provides
the info(either by hard-coded or defined in DT) anyway

Just like I said above, display controller should not query DDC
directly. Since CDF already defines these for us, display controller
should call CDF's functions, like: display_entity_get_modes,
display_entity_get_size... I think this is the key difference I wanna
talk about. And also in this way, display controller doesn't need to
care about this 2 steps logics, just call "display_entity_get_modes" is OK.
