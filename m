Cool, thanks. I am aware that this idea probably needs to be refined, 
but ideally we would end up with something as simple as this example.

Nice, I'll try to see how I can parse it then.

That sounds reasonnable, although we would also need to bind values to 
phandle types. That would make the DT a little bit more cryptic, 
although nothing too bad I think.

Yes, the power on/power off sequences are part of the board/panel 
specification - they are a hardware description and thus fits within the 
purpose of the device tree IMHO. One could argue that initialization 
sequences are usually coded inside drivers, but that only works when the 
driver has a single initialization sequence to handle. With 
pwm-backlight we try to handle something much more general, and so far 
these sequences were performed by board-specific functions.

All in all, adding timings & ordering is not so different from the 
original patch which accepted one optional regulator and GPIO.

Also, if someone knows of anything else besides PWM/GPIO/regulators that 
may need to be controlled by a backlight power sequence, please let me know.

Alex.
