Mike, a comment and a question:

First off, your git branch isn't based on tegra's for-next branch, but
rather something much in the future of it. Hence, the merge brings in a
bunch of unrelated changes. It is a fast-forward though so it's
probably fine?

Second, I tried to test this, but failed. I hit two issues:

1) USB didn't seem to work for me; the following prints continuously:

[   93.952248] usb 3-1: new high speed USB device number 126 using tegra-ehci
[   94.022291] hub 3-0:1.0: unable to enumerate USB device on port 1

This means I can't use the built-in SSD as the root filesystem.

I see this problem irrespective of whether I tell U-Boot to initialize
USB before booting or not.

Which branches did you have merged to test this? I did:

* Create a new branch from Tegra's for-next.
* Merge the branch from your pull request.
* Merge ASoC for-2.6.40 branch to pick up the audio driver.
* Cherry-pick a few I2C fixes I've been working on. I don't recall if
they are necessary for Trimslice or not, but shouldn't hurt.

2) I can boot into a recent ChromeOS filesystem on the SD card, and
see e.g. the audio driver initialize OK. However, both speaker-test
and aplay segfault immediately. They work fine on other HW, such as
Seaboard, with this disk image. I know this used to work on Trimslice
a few weeks back, so perhaps I'll go and try an older disk image.
