Running internally coccinelle is already credited with commit author.
The credits are coming with "From:" field.
Otherwise for commits I send I could use:
  From: krzk
  ...
  Reported-by: www.krzk.eu
  Signed-off-by: krzk
To me it is ridiculous.

Different thing is that Reported-by is for fixing bugs or issues.
There is no bug here. There is no problem solved except making the
code smaller. That's not what is Reported-by for.

Best regards,
