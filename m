Yes that's true. However, in order to make this work for everyone and
have a generic solution I am not sure how that can be avoided. If there
are cases where devices require multiple PM domains but the usage is
quite simple (ie. all on when device in use and all off when device is
not in use), I could see the APIs I proposed being extended to include
some _bulk() versions like we have for regulators.
