But, as far as I can tell, this setting is basically `which bits are
constant among this set of IDs'.

I disagree. If you have `sensible' StreamID allocations, doing this
dynamically should be straight-forward and gives the driver more flexibility
(e.g. we then have the option of combining SMR entries for different masters
if they are in the same domain). The dynamic approach also lends itself to
sanity-checking (it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the SMMU detects SMR
aliases) and helps with virtualisation (forcing QEMU to generate these masks
in a device-tree for a guest using a virtual SMMU interface is very painful).
