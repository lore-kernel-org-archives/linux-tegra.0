I will split this into sensible chunks.


As I mentioned before, linux/gpio/driver.h is included from several sub-systems,
so I need at least two development cycles to finish this task.


Maybe,

[1] Send patches to subsystems (gpio, pinctrl, etc.) for v4.14
     (splitting into sensible chunks, like per-driver)
[2] Drop unneeded includes from linux/gpio/driver.h for v4.15
