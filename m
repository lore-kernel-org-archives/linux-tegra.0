Removing the function calls isn't guaranteed to remove the body of the
functions though. Those functions aren't implemented in some separate
file that's optionally included, but rather are implemented in the same
object file, now unconditionally, and they in turn reference (with no
IS_ENABLED logic) other functions that are implemented in conditionally
linked files.

That would work.

However I'd like to avoid changing the body of those two functions at
all if possible, since I hope the PCIe driver rework will be merged in
3.10, and that will allow the Harmony and TrimSlice init functions to be
removed entirely. I'd rather not have conflicts with the removal patch.

That's not necessarily true. While we certainly don't plan to, I don't
think we can rule it out; after all, we don't have rfkill bindings and
yet other boards will need them.
