I wanted to kick this thread again now in the new year and see if there
is still some interest in pursuing this?

There is still very much a need from a Tegra perspective. I have put all
those who responded on TO.

I know that a lot of time has passed since we discuss this and so if you
are scratching your head wondering what I am harping on about,
essentially with this RFC I was looking for a way to support devices
that require multiple power domains where the domains do not have a
parent-child relationship and so not are nested in anyway.

If you need me to elaborate on the need for this, I am happy to do this.
My take away from when we discussed this last year, was that there was a
need for this.

Cheers
Jon
