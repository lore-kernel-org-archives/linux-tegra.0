The above is not 100% accurate. I would say that because there is no
chip-select address decoding, chip-selects either need to be managed via
software or by employing external chip-select decoding logic.

Again this is only true for the case where you have external chip-select
decoding logic, but would not be the case if software were to manage the
chip-selects.

Nit ... I think "nvidia,snor-cs" is sufficient for the name. But I am
not sure if we even need this. See below.

ce-width only occupies a 4-bit field and so the max is 15.

I think 0 for size makes sense. I know that caused you problems before,
but I am wondering if ...

... ranges is needed here? If we do have it, I am wondering if it should
be a single entry for the chip-select that is being used. For now we
could only support a ranges with one entry.

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges = <4 0x48000000 0x00040000>;

I would have expected these under bus@X node as they are specific to the
GMI CS.

I would also expect that the actual chip-select number is encoded in the
reg property.

bus@4

No mention of this bus node in the above documentation.

reg = <4>;

We should look up the chip-select from the reg property.

If we use ranges we could have ...

	can@0 {
		reg = <0x0 0x100>;
		...
	};

	can@40000 {
		reg = <0x40000 0x100>;
		...
	};

Nit ... please use tabs for spacing as we do in the dtsi/dts files.
