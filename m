Nothing is wrong with me. I just hit a point where the amount of half baken
crap tripped me over the edge and I let of steam. Sorry for that, it surely
wasn't necessary. It was one of those days where grumpiness took
control. My steam pressure is back to normal and I'm more than happy to put
that back on the pure technical level.

To be clear, that rant was not a shot at Baolin. It was definitely
addressed to the people behind him who set him on this project and then
failed to do any sanity checking.

Fair enough.

Yes, and I have to admit that I'm not a super human and despite trying to
control my emotions, there are points where I fail in doing so. It makes me
explode and that's it. I can assure Baolin, that this is nothing which
sticks. I'll look at the next patchset from a pure technical level. There
are surely precautions, but definitely no prejudice.

Right, that's why I early looked for co/sub-maintainers, but as you
admitted yourself, that's not always working out and I surely would
appreciate if there would be more help on all ends. I'm the last person who
rejects help, quite the contrary I'm very happy when I can mark mails as
'none of my business, somebody else takes care of that'.

Thanks,
