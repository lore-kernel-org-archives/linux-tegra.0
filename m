The patch

   ASoC: tegra: disable rx_fifo after disable stream

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.5

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: tegra: disable rx_fifo after disable stream

We see odd FIFO overruns with this, we assume the best thing to do is
to disable the RX I2S frontend first, and then disable the FIFO that
is using it.

This also fixes an issue where using multi-word frames (TDM) have
partial samples stuck in the FIFO which then get read out when the
next capture is started.
