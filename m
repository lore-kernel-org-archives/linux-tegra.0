dma-ranges defines a static mapping for mastering through the bus node.

The whole point of an IOMMU is that it maps dynamically, so I agree:
I'm unclear on what dma-ranges should mean in the IOMMU node itself
(if anything).

Do we have real examples of using a window *and* an ID?  I thought the
windowed-IOMMU concept was partly a way of encoding the ID in some
real address bits on the bus.  If you're doing that, it seems less likely
that there is a true "ID" as such (though it is possible).

In the strictest sense, no.

But for a large set of sane configurations, this probably works.

Small sets of randomly-assigned IDs can just be enumerated one by one.

We wouldn't be able to describe folding and bit shuffling, but we
probably don't want to encourage that anyway.
