Yes, probably. In any case, I don't think we want PWM users to be able
to mess up with the current or default PWM state, that's why I was
planning on making the pwm_set_default_xxx helpers private to PWM
drivers and core infrastructure.

Also note that if we keep this assignment it should at least be changed
to a pwm_set_default_period() so that it does not override the current
PWM state.
