Yeah, those sound sensible. I'm still a bit torn between this and just
enforcing PM. At least on the display side I think we already require PM
and with all the power domain work that you did we'd be much better off
if we could just get rid of the !PM workarounds.

But that's precisely the point. It's not just about this case. We've
already got some drivers where we do a similar dance just to be able to
support the, let's admit it, exotic case where somebody turns off PM. I
think supporting !PM might have made sense at a point where we had no
support for power management at all. But I think we've come a long way
since then, and while we may still have some ways to go in some areas,
we do fairly decent runtime PM most of the time, to the point where I no
longer see any benefits in !PM.
