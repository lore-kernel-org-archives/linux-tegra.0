OK. I did more stress tests last night and today. I found it cause by
the patch "ARM: tegra: cpuidle: use CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag" and
only impact the Tegra20 platform. The hot plug regression seems due to
this patch. After dropping this patch on top of v3.11-rc1, the Tegra20
can back to normal.

And the hop plug and suspend stress test can pass on Tegra30/114 too.

Can the other two patch series for Tegra114 to support CPU idle power
down mode and system suspend still moving forward, not be blocked by
this patch?

Looks the CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIMER_STOP flag still cause some other issue for
hot plug on Tegra20, I will continue to check this. You can just drop
this patch.

Thanks,
Joseph
