Thanks very much for looking into this.

The patch did alter the behavior a little for TrimSlice, but didn't
solve the problem. The old error messages:

Were replaced with the following with your patch:

This message appears from drivers/pci/setup-res.c pci_enable_resources()
due to:

> 		if (!r->parent) {
> 			dev_err(&dev->dev, "device not available "
> 				"(can't reserve %pR)\n", r);

> 		}

That check doesn't appear in ARM's custom pcibios_enable_device().
Disabling that check yields:

I think that's because the pci_dev's resources are initially assigned
PCI-aperture-relative addresses, and then these are later patched up to
take account of where the aperture is mapped into the CPU's address space.

I suspect this is all still related to the PCI devices themselves being
probed much earlier in the overall PCI initialization sequence when the
PCI controller is probed later in the boot sequence, whereas PCI device
probe is deferred until the overall PCI initialization sequence is
complete if the PCI controller is probed very early in the boot sequence.

Does anyone know where/what that "probe now" vs. "probe later" decision
point is? I'll try and track it down if nobody beats me to it.
