Greg KH is actively removing CONFIG_HOTPLUG altogether -- see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/9/4/489

That will make __devinit resolve to nothing in all cases, and we'll
eventually remove __devinit completely.  So we don't want to convert
__init to __devinit; we have to remove the __init altogether.  I think
that means we have to update all arches first to avoid the section
mismatches.

So I think Thierry is on the right track:
  1) Change all arch pcibios_update_irq() implementations (and
probably a few other things) to be non-__init
  2) Change pci_fixup_irqs() to be non-__init
