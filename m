The following patch series is targetted at two things - fixing the SDIO
interrupt handling, and fixing problems with the sdhci driver.

- the first two patches from Thomas Gleixner provide genirq support to
  allow us to fix the SDIO interrupt handling in a graceful manner.
- patch 3 adds support for avoiding the buggy sdio_irq thread - the
  problem is described in that commit.  Other solutions were explored,
  but this is the one which was settled on after discussions between
  Thomas, scheduler people and myself.
- patches 4 to 7 update sdhci to use a genirq to deal with the threaded
  part of the interrupts.
- patch 8 allows card interrupts to be received from a SDIO card while
  runtime suspended.  Without this patch, Wifi cards attached to a
  kernel with runtime PM support built in totally fail to work.  This
  allows them to work.  Tested in 4-bit mode.
- patches 9 onwards are cleanups and fixes to the sdhci code.
