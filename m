Agreed, when the first trip point is violated it would result in two
notifications. But this change was also supposed to address the cooling
cur state change that results from governor throttling after a trip
point is violated. I realize this intent was not communicated well in
the commit message, Patch V2 will fix it.

Agreed, Patch V2 will do the notify only once per thermal zone and only
when there is a trip violation.

Thanks for your inputs Srinivas, please take a look at Patch V2 that
addresses your comments.
