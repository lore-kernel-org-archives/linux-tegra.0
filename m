Ok so we should change the framework to allow drivers to only
implement set_rate_and_parent and use that in set_rate and
set_parent implementations if it's the only option available. Or
is there a problem if CCF allows clk_set_parent() on the EMC
clock by calling set_rate_and_parent() with the new parent and
whatever recalc_rate returns for the new parent's rate going into
the clock?

I'm not following this part. The CCF mostly asks clock providers
what parent should be used when clk_set_rate() is called.

Yes, I've sent a patch a while ago to support an idea of a "safe
parent" or a backup timing that can be used while a clock is
reprogrammed. Mike has also proposed the concept of "coordinated
clock rates" which would do something similar and allow clock
providers to control complicated rate transitions themselves. It
seems that we may be able to use the "safe parent" concept here,
where first we switch to some other parent, call the set_rate*
op, and then switch the parent back if we're not already using
the parent that we should be using.

This sort of thing becomes important for things like per-clock
locking where we need to know how the clock tree is going to
change *before* we modify the clock tree. If we go back and forth
between the clock providers and the clock tree while we're in the
middle of making irreversible changes to the hardware, we may get
stuck in a situation where we need to lock more clocks and then
we may need to undo hardware changes.
