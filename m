This looks reasonable, and I'll apply it soon. What is the patch based
on? Note that I recently sent a patch to fix the sort order of DT nodes
in all Tegra DT files, which I'll apply early since it's a cleanup, and
IIRC some of the KBC nodes may have been moved by that patch, so this
may conflict. I'll see if I can rebase while applying it.
