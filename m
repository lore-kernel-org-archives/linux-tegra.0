Because there is one Tegra20 board (tegra20-trimslice) that doesn't declare necessary regulators, but we want to have CPU frequency scaling. I couldn't find board schematics and so don't know if CPU / CORE voltages are fixed on Trim-Slice or it is just preferable not to have DVFS for that board, it is an outlet-powered device [0]. Hence tegra20-cpufreq driver will request a dummy regulators when appropriate.
