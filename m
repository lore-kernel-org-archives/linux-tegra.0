When going this way with my i.mx53 related dts files, I feel I like the
opposite way.

i.mx53 has many number of peripherals inside, while individual board
might only use small portion there.  For example, i.mx53 has 5 uart
controller instances inside, while quick start (aka loco) board only
uses one.  With the way you suggest here, we will have the following
in imx53.dtsi.

uart0: uart@... {
	...
};

uart1: uart@... {
	...
};

uart2: uart@... {
	...
};

uart3: uart@... {
	...
};

uart4: uart@... {
	...
};

And we will have to tell the 4 we do not use on quick start board in
imx53-qs.dtsi


uart1: uart@... {
	...
	status =3D "disabled";
};

uart2: uart@... {
	...
	status =3D "disabled";
};

uart3: uart@... {
	...
	status =3D "disabled";
};

uart4: uart@... {
	...
	status =3D "disabled";
};

Besides the bothering that we have to list so many unused controllers
in individual board dts file, it's also hard to tell which controllers
are actually available on the board.  People have to look at imx53.dts
to get a full list and then exclude the ones in imx53-<board>.dts as
"disabled".

And if we go the way opposite, adding "disabled" status for everyone
in imx53.dts, we will only need to specify the peripherals that are
actually available on board with "okay" status in imx53-<board>.dts.
And it's much more clear for people to see what peripherals are
available on individual board.

So I'm going the way than you suggested.  Please let me know if you
strongly dislikes it.
