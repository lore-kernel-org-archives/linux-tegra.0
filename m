Yes, the name of the node is not fixed (doing so would make its lookup
faster, but the gain is not obvious). Will make it explicit in the
doc.

Do you mean the vendor should be changed from "tl" to "nvidia" here?

I'm currently looking into that. This patch makes the assumption that
all TF implementations have the same features and the same interface -
if this is the case, do you agree this binding is ok as it is?

If indeed TF's functionality and ABI is the same no matter whether we
are on Tegra on not, then its support should even be moved outside of
mach-tegra.

Yes, I missed these ones, thanks. Another missed opportunity to use git grep...

What will happen (from 3.10) is that tegra_cpu_reset_handler_set()
will output a "CPUX: failed to come online" for each secondary CPU and
boot will continue (albeit on one CPU). The system's features are
degraded, but it is not fatal, so I think it is reasonable to continue
here.

Indeed. But even if that fails the system can still survive, at least on Tegra.

But then you will get a link error when TF support is not compiled in
because tegra_trusted_foundations_ops will not be defined. That's why
I used a #ifdef here - I agree it is terribly inelegant though.

One less register to save, I take it! :)

Thanks,
Alex.
