Yes, I think it should instead work like:

ARCH_TEGRA* selects nothing in particular related to USB.

The Tegra EHCI controller Kconfig depends on ARCH_TEGRA so it doesn't
show up for other builds. I hope it's OK for the EHCI controller to
select USB_ARCH_HAS_EHCI?

The Tegra EHCI controller Kconfig selects everything needed for it to
be useful, i.e. PHY support and the Tegra PHY, and I guess the ULPI
viewport options.

The Tegra PHY Kconfig probably shouldn't be user-visible (relying on
being selected by the Tegra EHCI controller) and itself selects
anything it relies on.

Does that sound reasonable?
