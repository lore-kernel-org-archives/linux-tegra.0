We should put this data into the soc_data struct in the driver, since it 
is easily determined from just the compatibility string; for example

struct tegra_ahci_soc {
	...
	uint32_t quirks;
};

then

.quirks = NO_DEVSLP | NO_DIPM

or the other way around and list the features that we want to enable. 
This is also quite easy to change to test.

The device tree should also only contain information that describes the 
hardware itself, and nothing related to any specific driver's operation; 
so if there's a possibility that some feature is not working due to a 
driver issue, then the device tree definitely should not contain any 
entry disabling that feature.

(The downstream kernel can of course carry such features as patches on 
top, if required for some reason - but naturally it increases 
maintenance effort)

Thanks,
Mikko.
