Either is fine; if it's a large series then a pull request tends to work
better. Catalin is handling the 3.20 merge window (we take it in turns).

Sure; if you have dependencies in other subsystems then we'd need either an
ack from the relevant subsystem maintainer or for them to publish a stable
branch that we can pull in. There's not really a hard-and-fast rule for
this but we can work something out.
