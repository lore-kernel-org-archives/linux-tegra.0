I think you are forgetting the case where a clock can adjust its output
rate but doesn't always have its .set_rate callback called.  The trivial
example of this is an adjustable divider that is downstream from some
parent clock whose rate is being changed.  In any such case it is quite
necessary to have a .recalc_rate callback on the downstream clock.

The sanity checks in __clk_init (and the documenation) make it clear
that .recalc_rate callbacks must exist due to this exact scenario.  I
guess we could leave it up to the implementor to "get it right" and only
provide .recalc_rate callbacks for clocks whose parents' rates might
change, but why take that risk?

My bit about being "cautious" above is not the driving force behind the
requirement for implementing .recalc_rate.  I thought that you were
specifically complaining about calling .recalc_rate AFTER we called
.set_rate, in which case my point above stands from the perspective of
being future-proof.

Your hardware even has a feature to sample it's own frequency at
run-time... does that mean your hardware doesn't trust itself?

Let's move past the "I don't trust the hardware" bit for a second.  It
is clear to me in your latest email that you not only think that we
should not call .recalc_rate immediately following a call to .set_rate
(which is an interesting point to discuss) but you also feel that we
should not have a requirement to implement .recalc_rate on clocks that
can adjust their rate again.

I'll only repeat what I said at the top of this email: for the scenario
where an adjustable-rate clock can have a parents' rate change it is
absolutely necessary to implement .recalc_rate to correctly determine
the chain of rates as we propagate down the tree.  That we force this at
the framework level is simply good design.

I'm willing to discuss removing the (sometimes) redundant .recalc_rate
calls immediately following .set_rate (since we basically perform a
preemptive .recalc_rate in clk_calc_subtree, called by clk_calc_rates).
But to assert that we can entirely remove the requirement to implement
.recalc_rates on clocks that support .set_rate sounds insane to me.

Please let me know if I've misunderstood what you meant by the
statement, "I don't see a need to force a recalc_rate ops".

What does this code buy us?

There is absolutely no difference in this code and it is misleading.
For the case where we do not implement .set_rate but we do implement
.recalc_rate (consider a fixed divide-by-2) this code would assign
clk->rate twice.

Furthermore we must still implement .recalc_rate in an adjustable-rate
clock for the case where a parent rate can change.  Thus every
adjustable-rate clock that implements .set_rate will also implement
.recalc_rate and both will get called in the code above, so we've gained
nothing here.

Your code above is functionally equivalent to the current
clk_change_rate but assigns clk->rate in three different places and is
more confusing.

It is enforced already.  Please review __clk_init.  I hope that after
reading this email you agree that anyone implementing .set_rate must
also implement .recalc_rate.

I like that we check the function pointer before calling it.  That is
sane.

Anyone that has read Documentation/clk.txt or reviewed the sanity checks
in __clk_init should realize the relationship between .set_rate,
.round_rate and .recalc_rate.  I see no reason to make the change above.
