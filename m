Hi Martin, Mark,

I have noticed that system suspend has started failing consistently on a
couple Tegra boards over the last few days with the linux-next branch.
The following error is seen on on entering suspend ...

[   58.222033] spi_master spi1: could not stop message queue
[   58.222038] spi_master spi1: queue stop failed
[   58.222048] dpm_run_callback(): platform_pm_suspend+0x0/0x54 returns -16
[   58.222052] PM: Device 7000da00.spi failed to suspend: error -16
[   58.222057] PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected

Bisecting today's -next points to commit 412e60373245 ("spi: core: avoid
waking pump thread from spi_sync instead run teardown delayed") and
reverting this on top of -next fixes the problem. I have not had chance
to dig any further but wanted to report this issue to see if you have
any thoughts.

Cheers
Jon
