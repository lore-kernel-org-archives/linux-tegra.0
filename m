Yes, a builder is quite useful. Several of us do our own builds as well.

When it comes to boot coverage, I'm not sure how successful a central
approach would be. It's something where I think Linaro could
contribute a lot for their member platforms, but I haven't seen much
engagement there yet.

Beyond there, I'd say the expectation is that each maintainer should
keep an eye on their own platforms. They _should_ try building and
booting linux-next on their platforms, to catch regressions early. And
definitely around now, I'd like to see people boot mainline on their
platforms to make sure we haven't added any severe regressions in the
3.10 merge window, etc. Some people are really good at this, others
less so.

What's the old saying, you can lead a horse to water but you can't
make him drink? You can build a boot test cluster but you can't make
anyone pay attention to it. :(
