That certainly seems like the most reasonable approach to me. Get KMS 
only in first. It's a useful driver as-is, and has the lowest barrier to 
entry into upstream.

Then later we can phase in enhancements. We certainly have plenty of 
places internally and externally to hash out acceleration interfaces, 
and come to some consensus at at later date (either on linux-tegra or 
direct email).

We have a lot of concerns here. What is best for X11, what is best for 
Android, how do we keep healthy open source implementations, and how 
does NVIDIA move forward with supporting new Tegra on an open source 
implementation. (My vote is NVIDIA starts using this DRM in-house and 
builds new extensions on top of it, sharing patches on LKML when the 
hardware is released)
