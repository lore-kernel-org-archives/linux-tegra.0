Based on what I can see, it seems that you're trying to describe two
pieces of hardware with only one device in the DT. That seems like an
odd choice. Also, it seems like all three SMMUs share the same interrupt
line? That's somewhat suboptimal IMHO, but harder to change.

Why not instantiate both of them and create a reference between then
such that the TLB and sync ops are done on both of them in the native
driver? I.e. two arm_smmu structs and a pointer between then (i.e. add a
"next shared smmu" pointer in the struct arm_smmu).

As long as devices only references one of them, locking only that one should
provide suitable protection as well.

Seems like a simpler approach than adding a new layer to the driver, but maybe
I am missing some complexity here?
