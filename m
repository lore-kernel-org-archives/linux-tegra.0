That is because there are no special requirements for the reg values 
beyond the HW documentation.

However, if we need the reg value to contain something other than the 
base address that's in the HW documentation, we clearly need to document 
that exception. How else would anyone know about the exception?

The example doesn't count because (a) it's not normative (b) an example 
wouldn't explain why an exception needs to be made or how to calculate 
the exception value for cases other than the specific example given.

That's not what I'm asking for. I want exceptions to standard practice 
documented, which is that reg contains whatever the HW documentation 
says it should. There's no need to enumerate all the valid values; the 
HW documentation does that. However, if the DT binding requires 
something other than what the HW documentation says, we must document that.

Almost yes.

We should not document Linux 4.1 as the cut-off. DT bindings are 
supposed to be OS agnostic. While it's practically unlikely, it is 
entirely possible for some other OS to have already implemented support 
for this binding, and the current binding is an ABI. We have no control 
over if/when any non-Linux code is updated to add support for a 0-based 
offset for existing SoCs, and certainly no versions of Linux or any 
other OS can be updated retro-actively except perhaps a few linux-stable 
versions. We can however write the binding in such a way as support for 
new SoCs requires the new 0-based address, since there is no binding 
specification for those new chips yet, and the time when you add the new 
binding documentation is the first time any OS could possibly add 
conformant support for it.

In summary, I believe the binding document must state that 
T20/30/114/124 require the offset of 4 in reg value, and newer chips 
require no offset in the reg value. We can still always accept either in 
the Linux kernel going forward based on the principle of being lenient 
re: input data.
