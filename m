But the code we've got won't do that either - it'l just set the voltage
to whatever the last thing the regulator API had that might have been
within its constraints.

I'm not clear that there's even a guarantee that the kernel will ever
have seen this configuration, consider for example what happens if
someone uses kexec?

I think given how you're describing the hardware that this will be
required in order to provide something robust (and also to get the best
power savings from the hardware).

I'm a bit confused here, we're talking about a change to the cpufreq
driver here aren't we?  Or alternatively why are we manipulating the
clock tree like this if we don't yet have support for the hardware?
