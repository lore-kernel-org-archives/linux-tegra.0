There is a design limitation to that, however.

The PM domain concept really is about intercepting the flow of PM
callbacks for a device in order to carry out additional operations,
not covered by the bus type or driver.  That's why there is only one
set of PM domain callbacks per device and I don't quite see how and
why it would be useful to add more of them in there.
