Hmm. I retract that Tested-by now.

If I apply the series on top of Tegra's for-next branch (which is
currently entirely based on v3.9-rc1) then it works fine. (Similarly, it
works fine on top of next-20130318, as I reported above).

If I merge in v3.9-rc3, it's still fine. If I merge in v3.9-rc4, I see a
hard hang during boot. I believe that "hard hang" here means that some
module's registers are being touched with the clock turned off, which
locks up the CPU/bus. Certainly, sysrq doesn't work once it's hung.

I tracked this down to some interaction with commit f7db706 "ARM:
7674/1: smp: Avoid dummy clockevent being preferred over real hardware
clock-event". So says a "git bisect" between v3.9-rc3 and v3.9-rc4,
applying this CCF V8 series at each point.

If I revert that commit, the problem is solved/hidden. I tested this in
my local dev branch that's based on next-20130325 plus this CCF V8
series, plus a bunch of other cruft.

Can you please investigate what the problem is? Thanks.
