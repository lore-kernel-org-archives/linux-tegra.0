Sorry. My original thoughts were that the schematics and specifications
are all completely available (internally) for these boards, as is a
complete known-working/tested DT for the board, so it's a relatively
simple exercise to take that and upstream it. As such, if we just did
all that in one go, it'd reduce churn by making a single patch to do the
whole thing once, rather than having lots of patches that build the
configuration up bit-by-bit. There's also the issue that we really do
need to set up the complete pinctrl configuration once up-front, to
avoid conflicts due to the same HW block being routed to multiple sets
of pins.

That's what I was thinking anyway. Evidently, I was wrong:-( Sorry.
