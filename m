So answering my own question here after testing this:

If I use a different (to iomap.h) virtual address in debug-macro.S, then
the very very early output from earlyprintk does work:

However, the kernel either hangs or output simply stops working at that
point. If I modify Tegra's iotable_init() call to add an entry to map
the UART to the virtual address debug-macro.S assumes, then everything
works again.

That implies we really do need to keep the two pieces of code completely
in sync, so a shared header is the right way to go. It also implies that
having duplicate mappings of the same physical address doesn't cause any
immediate obvious catastrophic problems.

Ways we might avoid files in arch/arm/include/debug having to use
relative include paths to pick up that header are:

a) Move mach-${mach}/include/mach/iomap.h to iomap-${mach}.h in some
standard include path.

b) Rework debug-macro.S so that it isn't an include file, but rather a
regular top-level file. In other words, rather than compiling
arch/arm/kernel/debug.S, and having that #include DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE,
instead compile DEBUG_LL_SOURCE (i.e. arch/arm/mach-${mach}/debug.S by
default), and have that #include any common parts (e.g. implementation
of printhex8). This has benefits of:

b1) arch/arm/mach-${mach}/debug.S is in the mach directory that owns it,
rather than having them all dumped into a common location.

b2) Can use #include "iomap.h", a non-relative include, to pick up the
shared header

b3) Perhaps we can simplify the current debug.S e.g. have a common
debug-semihosting.S that contains the semihosting stuff, and only
include that from mach-*/debug.S if that machine uses semihosting, or
similar?

(b) seems like a lot of work. I don't see any advantage of (a) over just
using the relative include.
