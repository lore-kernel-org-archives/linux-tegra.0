Intention here, is to use devm_ API and to adopt this I have to do thes=
e
modifications for "kstrdup" functions. I have seen in regulator folder =
almost
all drivers adopted to "devm_" API. Hence same thing I am following to
update this driver. Please let me know whether to go ahead with this pa=
tch
or retain driver as it is.
