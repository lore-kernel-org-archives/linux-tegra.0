Time to display on is important for many products. Having the console
up as early as possible is another case. CAN bus is another. This is a
real problem that is not just bad drivers.

I don't think it is completely ad hoc. Given all devices are
registered after drivers, drivers will still probe first in initcall
level order and then link order AFAIK. We may not take (more) initcall
level tweak hacks, but that is a much more simple change for
downstream. Don't get me wrong, I'd really like to see a way to
control order independent of initcall level.
