Hi.

I guess this is useful for some people, but I have concerns.

This shouldn't be done in terms of the "DEBUG_LL" stuff.  The DEBUG_LL
stuff is not designed to be multi-platform, it's designed as a last-ditch
method of debugging when other forms of kernel output have failed.  The
main requirement of the DEBUG_LL stuff is that it's usable from very
early on in the kernel assembly code, like from the first few
instructions in head.S, when the MMU is off.  This imposes quite a few
restrictions on the code.

Your code is not going to work with the MMU off, since you get the
virtual address of the 8x8 font, which is meaningless.

Rather than trying to bolt a framebuffer into the DEBUG_LL stuff,
please instead make the early printk support switchable between a
"DEBUG_LL" implementation and a framebuffer implementation.  It can
then live in early_printk.c rather than being spread around.

It seems that you may have already realised that, but not cleaned the
patch up - it's difficult to tell.  So, I think you need to remove
everything you don't need and re-submit.

This commenting out disables the framebuffer code.

printk() can be called in non-schedulable contexts, mdelay requires a
context that can schedule.  Therefore, you can't use mdelay() here.

You can't use ip here.

It would be nice if this were boot time selectable between implementations.

These pr_crit()s clearly don't belong in a production version of the
patch.
