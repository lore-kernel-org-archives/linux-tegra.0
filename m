Instead of using the ->provider pointer to know whether the genpd has
a valid provider, why not just add an additional ->has_provider bool
flag in the genpd struct?

Simply set the flag when adding the provider and reset it when
removing it. Wouldn't that work?

Perhaps a good idea. Although I agree, let's not make that change as a
part of this series.
