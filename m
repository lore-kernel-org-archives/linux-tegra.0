Ok, Should we document that after clk_get(), we should check for 
IS_ERR() only for validation. The way you explain earlier.
Documentation does not have this.
/**
         struct clk *clk;
         clk = clk_get(NULL, "my_gateable_clk");

         clk_prepare(clk);
         clk_enable(clk);
**/

The clk.h explain this:
  * Returns a struct clk corresponding to the clock producer, or
  * valid IS_ERR() condition containing errno.


The IS_ERR() return false for the null pointer. So as per you, it should 
be valid if the IS_ERR() false for returned pointer and hence NULL 
pointer should be valid for the clock driver.

Now we need to change the tegra_periph_reset_*() to accept the null pointer.

The issue is that information is getting passed to other part fo driver 
where it is dereferencing the pointer. Probably we need to work on the 
reset part also to move as part of clock driver to avoid this crash.
