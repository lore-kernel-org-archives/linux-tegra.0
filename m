The major difference between the PMCs are the powerdomain IDs. The Tegra30 IDs
are a strict superset of the Tegra20 IDs, but the Tegra114 IDs are not. There
are differences in the CPU domains and 3D. The CPU domains aren't a problem I
think because we won't powergate those domains directly using the PMC. We
always program the flowcontroller to do the powergating on WFI. 3D is a
different story however. We do powergate 3D under software control and the
sequencing is different between Tegra30 and Tegra114. Also Tegra30 has 2
domains for 3D while Tegra114 has only 1. Then ofcourse Tegra114 lacks the
SATA and PCIe domains because those features are missing compared to Tegra30.
But the IDs haven't been reused. All in all I think it's best to explicitly
require the driver to support the various SoCs.

Cheers,

Peter.
