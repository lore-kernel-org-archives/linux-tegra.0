I think that there are 2 cases:

  (1) discontiguous memory with IOMMU
  (2) contiguous memory without IOMMU(called "carveout" in general?)

For (1), the necessary info should be passed via IOMMU API as
mentioned in the previous reply, like DT->{GART,SMMU}->IOMMU->DRM.

  [PATCH 0/5] IOMMU: Make IOMMU-API ready for GART-like hardware
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/1/19/170

For (2), although memory is mostly anonymous one, we may need to know
how much to allocate, where we only need "size". This size is not from
h/w feature, but it depends on the system load/usage. So I think that
this size can be passed from kernel command line? For exmaple, we can
specify how much contiguous memory is necessary with putting
"coherent_pool=??M" in the kernel command line as below:

	coherent_pool=nn[KMG]	[ARM,KNL]
			Sets the size of memory pool for coherent, atomic dma
			allocations.
