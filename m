I don't think it's correct to think about "the IOMMU for the bus".

There could easily be multiple different IOMMU slave-sides attached to a
bus, and hence you'd need to defer probing until "all the IOMMs for the
bus" to be available.

Equally, I assume that dev->bus->iommu_ops rather assumes that bus
masters always master transactions onto the same bus that their control
registers are slaves upon. That also doesn't seem like a reasonable
assumption.

As such, I think an approach where each device waits for any IOMMUs that
affect it (wherever/whatever and however many they may be) is better
than one where we try to explicitly manage the probe order of devices
based on their slave registers' location.
