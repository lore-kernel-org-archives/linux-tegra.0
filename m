There has descriptior for lm90, I didn't post it.

Yes, it is the node for the skin temperature estimator driver.

Yes, I noticed that you have this sample in the documents, but it seems
the of-thermal only support one sensor in the thermal-sensors list, and
didn't handle the coefficients yet.
And in my skin temperature estimator driver, it will have more complex
logic to estimate the temperature, it will consider the history
temperatures, and have coefficients for every history temp, it seems
can't use your coefficients easily.
