The problem with the current approach is that people (me included) keep
telling people to use this or that error code in an attempt to achieve
some kind of consistency. Also using an error message to distinguish
between reasons for failure makes it impossible to handle the error
other than by visual inspection. Granted, there are currently no code
paths that require this.

One problem with the original patch was also that it didn't actually
convert any existing uses, so there was little chance of anyone noticing
potential problems. More than a year later this function is used by many
subsystems and a lot of drivers. It just so happened that I observed how
many people just didn't know what error codes to choose and often just
grabbing one randomly.

By adding devm_ioremap_resource() and having it return ERR_PTR()-encoded
error codes we get rid of all these problems and put the responsibility
for choosing the error code where, in my opinion, it belongs: the
failing function.

I'm not sure I like that very much. That could possibly lead to a new
problem where drivers that need to do something special have to jump
through hoops to achieve something that may otherwise be simple.

Anyway, if people don't think this is a sensible conversion I should
waste no more time on it. On the other hand I have the patch series
ready so I might as well post it for broader review.
