There's a copy of the DT binding documents in U-Boot as well. At least 
for the bindings I deal with, they should be the same, although the 
U-Boot copies might get stale as hopefully-backwards-compatible 
enhancements are made to the kernel versions.

I'm implementing a U-Boot driver for this new feature, so am copying 
these new binding docs into the U-Boot DT binding docs directory too.

I'd be happy personally not to have another copy of the bindings, and 
just tell people to refer to the docs in the kernel, or any other 
canonical source, but that's not my call.
