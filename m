So, the feedback on this is a bit all over the map, leaving me unsure
what to do next.  And is the choice we make on a per board/bsp basis or
ideally across all platforms?  I see the choices as:

1) do nothing; which IMHO is least desirable as it leaves the code
misrepresenting itself as modular; one of the key issues I wanted to fix

2) use the patches I've sent ; then as they are genuinely made modular,
the person doing so essentially "patch -R" or reverts the change as
step one.  This has the advantage of solving the "we'll get to it
someday" issue if someday never comes.

3) make them all tristate;  beat it with a stick until it compiles [M]
and modposts -- leaving the fixups and functional testing to people with
the boards and low level knowledge to make it _work_ as a module.  The
downside here is the code is still kind of misrepresenting itself as
modularly functional -- a ban of unloading might mitigate that some.
