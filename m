That seems reasonable to represent as a GPIO rather than a regulator since it connects directly into the WiFi device as a GPIO, and its use within the WiFi device can indeed be governed purely internally to the WiFi driver/HW. However, if this is some GPIO that controls the power to e.g.
>VBAT3V3_IN_WF, VDDIO_WF, or other power supply to the WiFi card, then it'd be better represented as a regulator, since the control point is outside the WiFi device.

Tegra uses two GPIO (WF_EN and WF_RST) to power on and reset bcm4329 card. In case of bcm4329, these two lines are shorted. Tegra does not control VBAT3V3_IN_WF, VDDIO_WF, or other power supply to the WiFi card based on these GPIO. Uses of these GPIO are internal to WiFi HW.  It is reasonable to represent as a GPU rather than regulator.

The "virtual platform device" is created before the real wifi device, so that it can pass the gpios to the driver, and power up the device before calling sdio_register_driver.
But as Franky said, this power sequence is only generally for 4329, not for the USB dongle chips. So it's not a good idea to add this "power up" in brcmfmac.

I think Rakesh may can answer this.
