I try to find the person who had the failing test that triggered my
involvement. That would basically just cover the case that the GPIO
controller is used as IRQ controller and needs to be enabled even if no
GPIO has been requested.
Suspend/resume may be more difficult. We have some out-of-tree code for
that. But unfortunately not 100% stable. I'll check what happens and
report back.
