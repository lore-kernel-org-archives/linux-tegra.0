In fact, with the of-thermal framework, the driver can't initialize to
any governor, even default governor, it may be a bug. As we discussed in
other mail list, we should not set governor in DT, and I think the
platform driver should be able to set to any governors which it want, so
I this patch, the driver can call the thermal_update_governor() to
switch to new governor in kernel space.
For example, there have two thermal driver, using of-thermal to register
thermal zone device. One want to set to step_wise governor, another want
fair_share, how can we do? I think after they calling the
thermal_zone_of_sensor_register(), they can call the
thermal_update_governor() to set the governor which they want.

Yes, I have consider to use "switch", but As my commit in the patch, in
the future, the governor may be more complex, it may need governor
parameter/configuration, and need to be tuned in run-time or in
initialization.
In fact we develop a new governor, based on PID logic. It will need some
parameters, such as proportional, integral and derivative. these value
will be initialized in different values for different thermal zone, so
we want to use the thermal_zone_device_update() to switch governor or
update the governor's parameters for different thermal zone.
