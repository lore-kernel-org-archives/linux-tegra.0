Lorenzo will be merging the Tegra stuff, so this is more a question
for him.

Just to clarify, I think your questions is about putting those patches
in
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tegra/linux.git#for-next.
If you put them there they will show up in linux-next, and then when
Lorenzo merges them, you'll have to coordinate so they don't get
merged into linux-next twice (once via the usual PCI tree route and
again via the Tegra tree).

If you wait until after they've been reviewed to put them into the
Tegra tree, I'm not sure what the gain is, because I assume Lorenzo
would merge them at about that same point.

This cycle isn't going to be ideal timing with all the holidays
coming up.  I know I'm going to be traveling and on vacation quite a
bit in the rc5, 6, 7 timeframe.
