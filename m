Hi Colin,

Thanks for your update. I understand what you are talk about. Actually,
I had tried it in the background for both Tegra20 and Tegra30. But I can
just ran several times of coupled cpuidle state. Then it dead locked in
the coupled cpuidle state. It's look like a race condition and dead lock
by missing IPI. I am sure the GIC was on and the IPI be fired. But
sometimes the CPU just can't catch the IPI. And I had a WAR for it by
doing a very short local_irq_enable and local_irq_disable in the coupled
cpuidle ready waiting loop. Then everything works. Not sure, did you
meet this before? Any hint about this?

Very interesting about "guaranteeing that they will not wake up from an
interrupt", did these CPUs go into power-gete cpuidle mode by wfe? If
the CPUs not wake up from an interrupt when doing cpuidle, how did them
be woke up? By sending event to these CPUs?

Thanks,
Joseph
