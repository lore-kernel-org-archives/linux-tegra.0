>>> I am planning to add tachometer support in pwm-fan.c driver (drivers/hwmon/) instead of adding new generic-pwm-tachometer.c driver. Measuring RPM value will be done in pwm-fan driver itself using pwm capture feature and will add new sysfs attributes under this driver to report rpm value of fan.

No. I hear you clearly that you for some reason dislike fan[1..n]_input.
While ABIs are not always to our liking, that doesn't mean that we get
to change them at our whim. If that is not acceptable for you, I can't
help you. And you can't change inX_input to inX_voltage either, sorry.
