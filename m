I see. Using default governor is not a bug. The thermal zone shall not
be defined in way that it is specific to a policy. We must remember that
DT is not used for specifying policies, but only describing hardware.

OK. But still, because you believe the platform driver has to set the
governor, this is not a bug. Defining which policy is used to control a
zone can be a later decision in the boot process. Specially because the
critical requirements are not dealt by the governors anyway.

I see.

OK. Now I get a better view of what you are trying to achieve with this
series. However, why can't you hand this decision off to userland,
during, say very early boot sequence?

You have got to be excited about what you are doing. (L. Lamport)
