Yes - my point is that the number of entries in the 1-byte binding
(with no row, column embedded) is unlikely to be more than the next
power of 2. So by avoiding including 2 or 3 unnecessary bytes we can
actually get a size reduction in most cases. It is also easier to
enter IMO. Can the Linux key codes fit in 8 bits?

Yes it would be better to use one binding, just so long as it is
efficient and doesn't introduce a lot of new complexity in U-Boot
which is useful only with fdt.

OK - just need some signal as to what key codes are modifiers.

Thanks for looking at this. We still have the need of the intermediate
table but since that is in BSS I don't think it is a problem.

I will have a look at this approach and see what the impact is, and
reply on this thread.
