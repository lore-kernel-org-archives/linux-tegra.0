No client of the API should know that; it'd be more like an agreement
between multiple functions in the subsystem:

handle = subsystemx_allocate_something();
...
subsystemx_use_handle(handle);

Where subsystemx_allocate_something() casts from ID to "pointer", and
subsystemx_use_handle() casts back from "pointer" to ID. The callers
would have no idea this was happening.

I'm not actually aware of any specific cases where that actually happens
right now, it's just that given the way subsystemx_allocate_something()
is documented (valid handle/cookie return or ERR value) it's legal for
"subsystemx" to work that way if it wants, and it should be able to
change between this cast-a-handle style and actual pointer returns
without clients being affected.

subsystemx_allocate_something() would have to ensure that. Probably just
by imposing a maximum limit on the handle/ID values.

Anyway, your proposal can certainly /work/. I simply wanted to point out
that it was different to the two currently accepted styles of return
value. If you're sure e.g. Russell isn't going to shout at me or you for
introducing an API that works as you describe, we certainly could go
ahead with it. Should we explicitly ping him to confirm that?
