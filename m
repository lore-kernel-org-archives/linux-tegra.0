Yes, will do.

Okay.

That'll add more dummy regulators and I don't think sprinkling them across
the DTS is going to work very well. Maybe collecting them under a top-level
"regulators" node is a good option. If you have a better alternative, I'm a=
ll
open for it.

Yes.

Okay.

Okay.

Yes, that's been on my mind as well. I'm not sure about the best binding for
this. Perhaps something like:

	pci {
		enable-ports =3D <0 1 2>;
	};

Would do?
