Correct.  And we have to update DT bindings and DTS.

That's exactly what we're doing already.
Which means that if you allow multiple entries in power-domains, we
have to change drivers, DT bindings, and DTS again (which we may
decide not to do ;-)

On SH/R-Mobile, we always did it that way, as the user manual had an
explicit "always-on" power domain.

On R-Car Gen2, the power domains contain CPU and L2 and GPU only,
so devices had their power-domains pointing to the clock controller.

On R-Car Gen3, some devices were moved into power domains, so we
generalized this by creating a virtual "always-on" power domain, and
letting all devices point their power-domains properties to the power
domain controller, which forwards clock handling to the clock controller.
For consistency, this was applied to R-Car Gen2 as well.

Cfr. some late relics fixed in e.g. commit 24b2d930a50662c1
('ARM: dts: r8a7794: Use SYSC "always-on" PM Domain for sound'),
but technically the fix was not needed, as it worked fine without.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
