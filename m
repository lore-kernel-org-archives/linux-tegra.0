The tegra124-cpufreq driver likely to be broken in regards to the module loading
as platform_device_register_simple() seem to be allowed invoked only from the
kernel itself.

Having platform_device_register_simple in the kernels module leads to a such
errors on the module loading:

# section 5 reloc 7 sym 'memset': relocation 10 out of range (0xbf805030 ->
0xc088c481)

Initially I wanted to make tegra124-cpufreq a module_platform_driver, but
decided to postpone that, as the driver is shared with ARM64 Tegra132 which
doesn't have machine-init code. Maybe we could move the devices instantiation to
something common like driver/soc/tegra/devices.c later.

Okay, thanks.
