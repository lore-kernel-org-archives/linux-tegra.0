Ok, looks like usleep_range is the way to go here. In that case it would 
probably not hurt to specify delays in microseconds in the DT and 
platform data as well.

Then I think there is a mistake in 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/nvidia,tegra20-pwm.txt:

"the second cell is the duty cycle in nanoseconds."

For tegra, we can only address PWMs this way IIRC:

pwm = <&pwm 2 5000000>;

If we had <&pwm 2>, I agree that there would be no problem. But here the 
period of the PWM is also given - and in practice, we can request the 
same PWM using different phandles. For instance, if the above property 
was part of the power-on sequence, and the following

pwm = <&pwm 2 0>;

was part of power-off, how can I know that these two different phandles 
refer to the same PWM without calling pwm_get a second time and getting 
-EBUSY?

Of course if the same period is specified for both, I will not have this 
issue as the phandles will be identical, but the possibility remains 
open that we are given a faulty tree here.

More generally speaking, wouldn't it make more sense to have the 
period/duty cycle of a PWM encoded into separate properties when needed 
and have the phandle just reference the PWM instance? This also seems to 
stand from an API point of view, since the period is not specified when 
invoking pwm_request or pwm_get, but set by its own pwm_set_period function?

On an unrelated note, I also don't understand why the period is also a 
parameter of pwm_config and why pwm_set_period does not do anything 
beyond setting a struct member that is returned by pwm_get_period (but 
maybe I am missing something here).
