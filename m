Perhaps are being created would be more accurate. Though technically
this isn't really about the new binding, or at least not the details.
The most important part here is that this implements the driver code
that will control per-lane PHYs. At least that part was what everyone
had agreed on was the right move forward.

Also the goal is to land this change before the switch for the XUSB
pad controller goes in, because otherwise PCIe will be broken. I can
reword the commit message to clarify this.
