Thanks for applying it. There is no issue on the reversing the sequence.

I tested this in may pieces, not with the bluez.
I tested this in downstream with linux-next dma, this new serial driver, 
some hacks in the board files with bluetooth.

Then I tested this again on linux-next with some hacks in board-dt filew 
with invoking  the driver from cardhu dts file. In this I tested driver 
registration, basic write is wokring or not with some register 
dump/interrupt, Not checked data integrity as not connected the serial 
sniffer. The idea is that nothing should be crash in linux-next. The 
basic driver code is already tested with bluetooth.
