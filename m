The bindings are in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/backlight/pwm-
backlight.txt . But you are right that the power supplies and GPIO will 
require a description of their own - I omitted it for this version because I 
am not sure what the driver should be called.

The panel used on Ventana is a Chunghwa CLAA101WA01A, maybe that's the name we 
should use for the compatible string instead (and rename the driver 
accordingly).

That was my initial intention, yes.

If we decide to make a "Tegra" driver, then I don't think the size of the file 
is a big issues, as long as one can easily navigate into it. It will make 
sense to do this since Tegra kernels should include support for all the 
boards.

If we go and name the drivers after their actual panel names, we should 
definitely put them into separate files. The Tegra configuration could then 
include them all by default to make sure all boards are supported.

Alex.
