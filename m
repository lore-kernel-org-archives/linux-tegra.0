That property sounds a bit scary; is the value a single parent IOMMU?
What if an IOMMU splits its requests between two different parent IOMMUs
based on some property of the request. I hope smmu-parent isn't going to
get us into another interrupts -vs- interrupts-extended situation.

(/me checks the documentation of that property)

I suppose smmu-parent is documented in a device-specific binding rather
than as a generic property, although there's no vendor-prefix on the
property name:-(, so we havne't cornered ourselves too much here; any
IOMMU device which actually has multiple parents can always define its
own custom property to represent that.
