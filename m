I don't want that, and actually I agree with the conclusion "overboard".

It was really about exploring the problem space, including things that
we can reasonably foresee.  Any bindings today should necessarily be
much simpler, and that's certainly the correct approach.

I've been neglecting this thread (apologies) -- but although I have to
think a bit about Thierry's most recent suggestions, I think there's
actually reasonable alignment now.

Well, some of it might be.  But I'm not saying we should give in to
wild speculation (except to get a feel for what we're ruling out, and
the consequences of that).

Can you elaborate on that?

Master ID signals in ARM systems and how they are handled are rather
under-specified today.  Treating the master ID bits as some extra bits
in some kind of extended bus address could work for ARM IOMMUs etc.,
but I didn't have a complete answer yet.
