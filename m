Register counts are the same, but the SNOR_CONFIG_0 is not identical. I
believe only Tegra30 defines bit 14.

Yes it would be cosmetic. That said, I even wonder if CS needs to be
exposed at all given that they all map to the same CPU address space.
Couldn't your binding for the CAN devices be as follows?

nor@70009000 {
	...

	can@48000000 {
		...
	};

	can@48040000 {
		...
	};
};

Problem is if you did have devices on different chip-selects then how
would these be handled? They could not point to the same physical
address. I am not sure if there is a way to do that in DT?

Jon
