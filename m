I'm not asking for special treatment here. :) I'm requesting one set
of maintainers (arm-soc maintainers) to push back on changes that
don't get platform idle drivers in sync with the consolidation work
that is currently ongoing.

This will speed up the process since it is hard to track every
SoC-specific list for these changes. Some platform maintainers might
not even be aware of it (those that Daniel hasn't modified yet). A
similar approach seems to have worked for common clock, DT, pinmux,
etc.
