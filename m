On many platforms, we have U-Boot SPL running first, then the main
U-Boot. The main U-Boot binary contains both the code to do the
relocation and the binary that runs after relocation. It seems like it'd
be simpler to split these up into 3 binaries that each do a single job:

1) SPL, roughly as-is today (varying jobs depending on platform)

2) Relocator, which does nothing but work out where to copy U-Boot,
memcpy()s it there, relocates the image (if not PIE), and jumps to it.

3) The main U-Boot.

Item (2) above should be simple enough that it can use a very simple
debug mechanism rather like DEBUG_LL in the Linux kernel. Similar to
what Rob mentioned in his email.

Item (3) could use DM and DT/ACPI/... to get device information in a
complete non-hard-coded manner.
