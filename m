I think using the device ID is fine. If nothing else it'll at least
document the various device IDs. Perhaps you could extend this patch
with comments as to which device ID maps to which SoC. Or better yet
add them to include/linux/pci_ids.h with names matching the SoC.

Also I'm wondering if perhaps it'd be better yet to add these as a table
of struct pci_device_id:s and use pci_match_id() to avoid the switch
here. Granted, the table will be bigger in size because of the unused
fields, but it'd more clearly separate the data and code.
