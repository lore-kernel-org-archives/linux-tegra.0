I think we need to phase things. Let's start with warning people for a
few kernel releases. Actively maintained platforms will quickly address
the issue (fixing their DT). As I see it, this issue seems rather
widespread (even kvmtool outputs a DT with the wrong triggering
information).

Once we've fixed the bulk of the platforms and virtual environments, we
can start thinking about making it fail harder.
