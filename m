I think that an IOMMU device is also the service provider for other
devices, where an single IOMMU device resides in the bus to provide
the address translation to the bus children.

Other devices don't know if the system has IOMMU or not. IOMMU'able
devices' population can be deferred till IOMMU device is populated,
but they don't know if there's really IOMMU device exists or not at
their population time.

I have a problem to control the poplution order for IOMMU in Tegra
SoC, and currently I haven't found any framework so that I inserted an
IOMMU hook in the driver core[1] since I discussed with Stephen Warren
and we thought that the number of those subsystem which requires this
kind of control isn't so many. This patch depends on a certain DT
bindings("#stream-id-cells") if a device has an dependency on IOMMU or
not. But at least this doesn't require anything for a client driver
side at all. The exsiting driver can be used as they are. The current
design is:

1, When a device is populated, it checks if that device is IOMMU'able
   or not. This is identified by "#stream-id-cells" in DT. If
   a device is normal(non IOMMU), a device is populated. If a device
   is IOMMU'able, it continues to be checked.

2, When an IOMMU device has been already populated,
   "dev->bus->iommu_ops" is set. If so a device(client) is registered
   as IOMMU'able, and the rest of population process continues. If not
   set yet, a device population would be deferred til
   "dev->bus->iommu_ops" is set.

3, After an IOMMU device has been already populated, deferred
   population will be continued.

I'm not so sure if this dependecy on "#stream-id-cells" is acceptable
or not, but I haven't any better idea right now.

Any suggestion/hint would be really appreciated.
