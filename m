Apologies for this. I believe you've hit the same problem as Stephen Warren [1].

The broadcast function is now meant to be set by timer core, but unfortunately
I made a mistake when adding the functionality such that it isn't set for
timers with CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP. I posted a fix [2] on Friday, but so far
I've had no reply.

Thomas, are you happy to take the fix at [2] ?

That's a minor cosmetic defect. We shouldn't touch smp_timer_broadcast at all
now.

Hopefully with [2], I've fixed 2. I'll fix 1 shortly. :)

Thanks,
Mark.
