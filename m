8250.c needs a specific PORT_TEGRA type for two reasons:
* RTOIE bit needs to be set, but UUE is reserved, so split RTOIE handling
  out of PORT_XSCALE.
* A WAR is needed for break reception.

I'd like to get the first of these two patches merged into the tegra
arch for-next branch, so that I can modify the board files to explicitly
request the new port type rather than relying on auto-detection. As such,
could you please create a branch for that/these changes, then merge it
into tty-2.6.git, so that the same branch can be merged into Tegra's
for-next branch. Thanks.
