Many cases are already agnostic in the drivers in terms of the *_get()
functions. Some are DT specific, but probably because those subsystems
are new and DT only. In any case, I don't think these 1 line changes
do anything to make doing conversions here harder.

Considering at one point we did create a fwnode based API, we did
think about it. Plus there was little input from ACPI folks as to
whether the change was even useful for ACPI case. In any case, we're
talking about adding 1 line.
