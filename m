If we allowed that, it would also solve the following comment in patch
2 in this series, in the Tegra GPIO driver:

int tegra_gpio_request(struct gpio_chip *chip, unsigned offset)
{
	/*
	 * We should call pinctrl_request_gpio() here. However, we can't. Tegr=
a
	 * muxes pins in groups not individually, and real boards exist where
	 * most of a pin group needs to be used for some function, yet some of
	 * the pins aren't actually used by that function in the mode the
	 * controller operates on the board, and so those pins can be used as
	 * GPIOs.
	 *
	 * This is true in practice on Seaboard/Springbank, where pin group AT=
C
	 * is used by the NAND controller, but pin GMI_IORDY_PI5 is used as a
	 * GPIO for the SD card slot's CD signal.
	 *
	 * On Tegra30, pins are muxed in groups and hence we could call
	 * pinctrl here, but we don't for now.
	 */
	tegra_gpio_mask_write(GPIO_MSK_CNF(offset), offset, 1);

	return 0;
}

i.e. we actually /could/ call pinctrl_request_gpio() here.

And in turn, the I2C driver (in your example) and SPI driver (in Russel=
l's)
would never have to call pinctrl_disable() and hence the issue I raised
in my previous email would not occur.

The one downside here:

Ignoring WARs like we're discussing, it's typically true that a given p=
in
should either be a special function or a GPIO for any given board. If
we do allow a pin to be owned/used by both, then how do we indicate, on
a per-board rather than per-SoC basis, which pins we should allow both
gpio_request() and pinmux usage? The following considerations exist:

a) On Tegra, a pin group might include 10 pins that are mux'd as a grou=
p,
hence all owned e.g. by a NAND driver. If a few of those aren't used on=
 a
particular board due to the way the NAND is hooked up and the driver
configured, do we only allow gpio_request() only on those pins we know =
the
NAND driver isn't actually using, to prevent someone using unexpected
pins as GPIO? We'd need a per-GPIO per-board way to represent this if
we care about this level of error-checking.

b) In Linus's snooping example, how do we know the SoC can physically
implement enabling a pin as both a GPIO and a special function, such
that the gpio_request() for the snooping won't interfere with the mux'd
function? On Tegra, any GPIO usage is mutually exclusive with mux usage=
;
enabling GPIO even for input, disconnects the input side of the pin fro=
m
any HW module other than GPIO irrespective of mux function. IIRC,
somewhere some per-pin data was mentioned for this.

We could either:

1) Just ignore these issues, and allow both mux and GPIO ownership at
once of any pin, and leave it up to platform data or device tree author=
s
to give the correct GPIO IDs to drivers. This is possibly reasonable, b=
ut
I just want us to make this a conscious decision.

2) Extend the pinctrl mapping table to explicitly represent GPIO usage.

This is required anyway for HW where there isn't a 1:1 mapping between
GPIO ID and pin ID, e.g. 1 pin could be used for two different GPIO
signals, e.g. 1 from each of 2 different GPIO HW modules, with differen=
t
capabilities, or where 1 GPIO could be routed to one of 2 or more pins.

In other words, make "gpio" an explicit mux function, thus allowing
pinctrl_select_state() to directly transition between special function
and GPIO usage, rather than having separate pinctrl and GPIO APIs for
this. This way would entail dropping my Documentation/gpio.txt patch
completely, I think.

If we do this though, I think we'd want to extend pinctrl to allow muxi=
ng
on pins too, so that we don't need to create a pin group for every pin =
to
support per-pin GPIO ownership. This would also help out all the HW tha=
t
already muxes everything per-pin, since they need to create these singl=
e-
pin groups right now... I somewhat anticpated this in my naming of the
mapping table convenience macros in the most recent pinctrl patch I pos=
ted
to add pin config mapping table entries.

Thoughts?
