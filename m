Objective is to have things working with or without CONFIG_PM enabled.
 From previous comments and discussions it appears that there is mixed=20
response
for calling hda_tegra_runtime_resume() or runtime PM APIs in probe()=20
call. Need
to have consensus regarding the best practice to be followed, which=20
would eventually
can be used in other drivers too.

Rafael is suggesting to use CONFIG_PM check to do manual setup or=20
runtime PM setup in probe,
which would bring back the earlier above mentioned concern.

if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PM)) {
do setup based on pm-runtime
} else {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 do manual setup
}
Both if/else might end up doing the same here.
Do we really need CONFIG_PM check here?

Instead does below proposal appear fine?

probe() {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 hda_tegra_enable_clock();
}

probe_work() {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 /* hda setup */
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 . . .
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 pm_runtime_set_active(); /* initial state as active */
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 pm_runtime_enable();
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 return;
}

remove() {
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 pm_runtime_disable();
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 if (!pm_runtime_status_suspended())
 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 hda_tegra_runtime_suspend(); /* take=
s care of both CONFIG_PM=20
enable/disable case */
}

One of the other concern was, remove() and probe() do not appear to be=20
in sync, because in probe() hda_tegra_enable_clock()
is called and in remove() there is hda_tegra_runtime_suspend() to=20
effectively disable clock.
IMO, this should be ok since it can avoid duplication and proper comment=20
can be added here for clarity.
Alternatively we can call hda_tegra_runtime_resume() in probe()=20
unconditionally to avoid confusion.

Another point Thierry mentioned was, after successful probe()=20
power-domain would be turned OFF. It seems Rafael had a different
view. I am little confused here. Kindly clarify if above proposal seems=20
fine.

Thanks,
Sameer.
