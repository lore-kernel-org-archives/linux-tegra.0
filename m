Yes, As Russell says it is entirely possible that the earlier section
was __INIT and there was already a missing __FINIT (or .previous).

Hence what was __cpuinit got grandfathered into __INIT instead of
.text/.data/.bss

I'm offline at the moment but will double check myself later this
evening if nothing obvious has been found by then.

Thanks,
Paul.
