No, platform data should stay around forever. Otherwise, consider what
would happen if your driver is built as a module and you unload and load
it again.

I agree. Furthermore the driver unload/reload would be another reason
not to reuse platform data as the output of the build() function.

But maybe what Stephen meant was more like filling a structure with data
taken from the platform data and pass that to a resolve() function which
would fill in the missing pieces like pointers to actual resources. I
imagine a managed interface would become a little trickier to do using
such an approach.

It's not technically valid to not have the reg property. Or
#address-cells and #size-cells properties for that matter.
