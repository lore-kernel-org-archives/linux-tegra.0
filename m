Is there a specific reason for that; is there some problem in the core
ARM code that implies CPU0 should never be disabled?

If there is a problem removing CPU0 in the core code, the functionality
of this series is OK, although it's probably worth removing the parts
that attempt to make CPU0 hot-unpluggable to reduce the diff size.

If there's no problem removing CPU0, it'd be good to make it work,
although that could be done in followon patches.
