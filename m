I chucked this into linux-next in order to prove that the issue I had
been reporting was not specific to my systems here (because I was making
absolutely no useful progress with Mark.)  Mark finally admitted for the
first time that there's a bug here yesterday, so I've now dropped the
patch out of linux-next (either that's coincidental or cause and effect).
In any case, it's served its purpose.

As for how to solve the underlying problem, I have no idea - I've been
asking the same question of Mark for the last three weeks and just been
getting a load of drivel about "it's because you're using DPCM" and
other *totally useless* suggestions about the code I'm trying to get
working.

Liam says he's working on "a patch" last week, so I assume that this
issue will eventually be resolved.
