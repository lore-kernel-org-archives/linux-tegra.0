First, sorry for the delayed response, with summer vacation and then
trying to catch up.  :-)

Yes, this is an excellent point.  I will change the user tool to use
/sys/class instead and then it will work with the existing kernel as well
as with future kernels that incorporate your suggested change.

The second argument should be &srom_parent.dev though, I think.  Right?

Yes, that seems slightly unfortunately but not too problematic.  If the
consensus is that this is the way to go, I can certainly take this change
into the Tile tree.
