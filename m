That's what I thought :-)

So the GMI has 8 chip-selects and these can be used by either the SNOR
interface for MIO interface. As you mentioned the chip-select used for
the SNOR interface is configured by the field SNOR_SEL in the
SNOR_CONFIG and similarly the chip-select for the MIO interface is
configured by the MIO_SEL field in the MIO_CONFIG register.

Looking at the Tegra20 TRM, the SNOR interface is mapped to the address
range 0xd0000000-0xdfffffff and the MIO interface is mapped to the
address range 0xe0000000-0xefffffff. If chip-select 0 is used for SNOR
and chip-select 1 is used for MIO, you can support two devices at the
same time and they will be accessible via different address ranges.
Whether you can use the MIO interface for the 2nd device is another
question.

If you want to support two 256MB NOR devices on the SNOR interface, then
you would need to reconfigure the SNOR_CONFIG each time you swap between
the two devices.

Yes.

That would make sense. However, I am not sure how that would work with
the client drivers, such as the CAN driver Mirza is using, that wishes
to read/write directly to the SNOR address space. I am guessing that SPI
works like I2C and buffers up the requests and performs them in sequence.
