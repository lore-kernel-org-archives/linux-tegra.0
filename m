I would hope that was guaranteed; the only reason to move one of the
ranges would be a HW design change, and if there is a HW design change,
HW should take that opportunity to fix the interleaved register mess
instead of making it worse, and hence we could just have a single
register range after that point.

Yes, that kind of checking looks much better if this is all going to be
dynamic.

I would suggest enabling the checking all the time rather than hiding it
inside an ifdef; how many people build that file with DEBUG enabled?

Or perhaps you could check each register in probe() somehow.

I don't see regbase in the existing driver or your patch. Are you
proposing to simply make readl/writel add the offset onto a base address
that's calculated like that? That may not work in general; if the SMMU
register ranges cross a page boundary, and the various separate ranges
end up getting mapped to non-contiguous virtual addresses, using a
single base address won't work.
