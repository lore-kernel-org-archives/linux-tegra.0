This would require a callback dedicated to this in display_entity and
would break its simple design.

Well the fact is that it *is* the display controller that queries DDC
directly. The panel is just a bus here, and the EDID EEPROM could
perfectly work without it. If you model what you described with DT
nodes, I'm afraid you will end up with something both complex (with DC
node referencing panel node and back again for the EDID bus) and that
does not picture reality accurately.
