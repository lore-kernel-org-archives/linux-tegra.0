I didn't care much about the complexity, more trying to understand how
the HW actually works. :-)

So, is this really is a proper description of the HW? Isn't it so,
that the usb device always resides in one and the same PM domain?

Now, depending on the selected speed mode (superspeed) additional
logic may needs to be powered on and configured for the usb device to
work?
Perhaps, one could consider those additional logics as a master/parent
PM domain for the usb device's PM domain?

Or this is not how the HW works? :-)

Kind regards
