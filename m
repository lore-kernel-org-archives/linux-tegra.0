You are right, the API is already complex. The idea of adding page array came after
explaining once again how the _sg functions work and how to use them for this
specific use case.

There is one more point for page array. Scatter-lists are also very inefficient
in terms of the used memory. In the worst case we create a single scatterlist 
entry for every single page of the large buffer. For each entry we really use 
only a page pointer, leaving offset at zero and size set to 4KiB, dma_address
and dma_length entries are usually used only for the first element in the list.

On the other hand scatter lists are the only way to describe a complex block IO
requests which is spread across multiple io buffers, which are smaller than a
single page.

Having a specialized set of functions in the API is not bad in general. Maybe
the obscurity of the current _sg functions was the reason that almost every 
developer involved in gfx/multimedia and memory management tried to provide 
his own solution instead of using the dma-mapping api. 

We already have dma_map_page() and dma_map_single() which are very similar. 
Maybe adding dma_map_pages() won't be such a bad idea? 

If not maybe we should provide some kind of helper functions which converts 
page array to scatterlist and then maps them.
