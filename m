Waiting for -rc6 is generally risky, because it means that if we find
something seriously wrong with a few of the patches, it can happen that
you don't get anything in at all.

For most maintainers it seems to work out well enough that they send us
whatever they are comfortable with early, but hold back some other
changes. Most of the per-soc trees are also part of linux-next themselves,
but generally speaking if you consider things ready for linux-next,
you should be able to send them to us, possibly after waiting for a
few days to look for regressions in linux-next.
