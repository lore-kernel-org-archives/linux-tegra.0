My immediate answer is "Why?".

As you pointed out, we don't even try to program the GICD_ICFGR1
register if what we read from it is the right thing. Also, the GICv2
spec says in 4.3.13: "For PPIs, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the
most significant bit of the Int_config field is programmable.".

So NONE is always wrong (because there is no such thing in the HW), and
the DT should have a setting that matches the HW even GICD_ICFGR1 is RO
(the OS may need to know how the triggering configuration anyhow).

Aniruddha: what problem are you trying to solve here? The DT you're
touching seems just fine to me...

Thanks,
