It should be fine to merge the arch/arm/mach-tegra/ changes in this
patch through the cpufreq tree, since I don't think they'll conflict at
all with anything in other trees this kernel cycle.

Nit: Given this driver is explicitly for a 2-CPU SoC, I don't think
there's any need to s/NUM/MAX/ here. But I don't care that much.
