I haven't looked at all the patches in detail yet, but I do like
the approach in general. I've also applied and pushed them out for
build+test here, but they're queued behind a couple of other builds
so I won't have it until morning (you can poll for boot logs at
arm-soc.lixom.net/bootlogs/misc/v3.16-rc4-371-g2c9d948 if you want to
preempt me).

I thought I saw a patch from Peter that moved the apbio read code to
the fuse driver since there are no other consumers. I think that's a
reasonable thing to do.
