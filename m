I think you answered "why is the switch to CLK_M performed very late",
whereas I asked "where is the code that performs the switch to CLK_M".

Is there a guarantee that the syscore_ops are run after the call to
tegar_cpu_car_ops.resume() would be? Perhaps the mach-tegra/ code should
simply call tegra_cpu_car_ops.resume() later on Tegra114 than it does on
earlier chips, so it's run at a suitable time?
