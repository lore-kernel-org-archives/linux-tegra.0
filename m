Yes.

That seems to be a typo. It should have been 0xa8000000 in the second
case. The PCIe controller has registers that are programmed with the
aperture for the configuration and extended configuration spaces, as
well as the downstream I/O, prefetchable and non-prefetchable memory
regions.

The configuration spaces aren't actually forwarded by the bridges, but
are handled only by the controller. The other apertures are programmed
into the bridges using standard PCI registers.

Not yet. I don't think DT imposes a bus number allocation on PCI
bridges. However the matching of DT nodes to PCI bridges is done based
on the bus number. For that you provide a bus-ranges property which
defines the bus aperture of the given PCI bridge. The DT matching code
compares the first cell of this property with the primary bus number of
the bridge.

This is in fact somewhat counter-productive because it requires you to
hard-code the PCI hierarchy within the DT and you loose a lot of the
probing functionality. This is not much of an issue for typical PCI
endpoints (like network cards) but becomes a problem if you have a PCI
endpoint that implements an I2C bus and you want to match I2C slaves on
that bus to device nodes so that the kernel can parse and instantiate
them properly. I guess in the latter cases hard-coding the PCI tree in
DT is not actually a drawback, though.

I only have access to the PCIe 2.0 specification, but it seems to
contain the same 7.2.2 section. In fact it looks as though this
particular controller indeed implements something similar to ECAM. The
address mapping is a little different, though:

	A[(16 + n - 1):16]: bus number
	A[15:11]: device number
	A[10:8]: function number
	A[7:2]: register number
	A[1:0]: unused

That information comes directly from the driver and I have no access to
the corresponding documentation. It seems like the extended
configuration space is accessed using the same mapping but starting at a
different base address.

But now that you mention it, maybe the driver code is buggy here, and
the controller indeed implements ECAM. Furthermore it also seems like
the current code doesn't work for the extended configuration space
because while the correct offset into the extended configuration space
is chosen, the access to registers is done using the same mapping as
above, so instead of the 12 (10) bits required for the register number
only 8 (6) are in fact used.

I wonder whether anyone's actually tested this.

Stephen: can you try to find out whether the Tegra PCIe controller
indeed implements ECAM, or if this scheme is actually just a proprietary
variant?
