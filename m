You can find to code in the function tegraXX_switch_cpu_to_clk32k of the
patch 5/8 and 6/8. It switches the SCLK and CCLK to CLKM before
disabling the PLLs.

OK. It's a little difference we do in clock driver side and low level
code side.

As you knew, we have two CPU clusters (CCLKG & CCLKLP) in Tegra chips.
And they have exactly the same clock source for Tegra20/30, but
Tegra114. From the low level side, it should be supported when the
system going to suspend with CPU_G or CPU_LP. So we switched the clock
source of CPU to CLK_M by CCLK_BURST_POLICY. This register can support
the running CPU switch to the clock source they want.

On the clock driver side, because the clock source of CCLKG and CCLKLP
is not exactly the same for the Tegra114. The CCLKG supports DFLL clock
but CCLKLP. We need to restore it separately to avoid the CPU restore to
the wrong clock source.

The CPU clock suspend/resume function in the tegra_cpu_car_ops of
Tegra20/30 is also using CCLK_BURST_POLICY register, because the
definition of the clock source of CCLKG and CCLKLP is the same. We can
simply the code for just using CCLK_BURST_POLICY.

I think the code should OK when CPU_G or CPU_LP running with it.
