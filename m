Yes. I think it can be always higher than pll_p, but that assumes the display
driver will always program the highest possible rate for pll_c for a given mode
and then program the display divider to divide it down to the required rate.

Tegra20 doesn't have dynamic ramp PLLs no. So you always have to switch to a
backup clock source before changing the rate of pll_x.

I think this should work, but as you mention it may very well be lower than
pll_p if Tegra20 EMC scaling is re-introduced. I think that's why historically
this was never done.
