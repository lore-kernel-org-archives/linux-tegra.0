I think I like the former better. The way I understand it the children of t=
he
graphics node will have to be registered explicitly by the DRM driver becau=
se
of_platform_populate() doesn't work recursively. That would ensure that the
DRM driver can setup the CRTC and output registries before the other devices
call back into the DRM to register themselves.

Boards should still be able to boot and display a console on the "standard"
output even if the user doesn't provide a video=3D option. Shouldn't there =
be a
way for a board DTS to specify what the default (or even allowed) connectio=
ns
are?

Evaluation hardware like the Harmony might have LVDS, HDMI and VGA connecto=
rs
to provide for a wide range of use cases. The Plutux for instance has only =
an
HDMI connector and the Medcom has only LVDS. For the Medcom it would be qui=
te
confusing for people to suddenly see an HDMI-1 connector pop up f.e. in
xrandr. It would be equally useless for the Plutux to show up as supporting
an LVDS or VGA connector.

I see. Maybe this could be used for board-specific configuration? For
example, the Plutux could have something like this:

	connectors {
		hdmi {
			output =3D <&hdmi>;
			ddc =3D <&i2c2>;
		};
	};

The Medcom could have:

	connectors {
		lvds {
			output =3D <&lvds>;
			edid =3D <&edid>;
		};
	};

While Harmony could be more generic and provide more outputs:

	connectors {
		lvds {
			output =3D <&lvds>;
			ddc =3D <&i2c1>;
		};

		vga {
			/* which output is used for VGA? */
			output =3D <...>;
			ddc =3D <&i2c2>;

		hdmi {
			output =3D <&hdmi>;
			ddc =3D <&i2c3>;
		};
	};

Has there been any discussion as to how EDID data would best be represented
in DT? Should it just be a binary blob or rather some textual representatio=
n?

I've looked at them in more detail and I'm not sure that they're very well
suited for the Tegra. I think they may be a bit too simple to support
advanced features that will be required for Tegra. For the current state it
may be enough, but people at NVIDIA and Nouveau seem to be eager to start
working on things like 2D acceleration and I wouldn't want to convert to SD=
RM
now just to convert it back when somebody needs a feature that can't be add=
ed
with SDRM.
