I finally got around to testing this on the Ouya (Tegra 3).

I found that the "Got command interrupt 0x00010000 even though no 
command operation was in progress." error occurred when the interface is 
unstable.
I've had a lot of problems with sdmmc4 stability on the Ouya above 34 
Mhz, probably due to the fact that they are using the internal cmd and 
clock pull-up resistors, against the TRM's instruction.
At 39Mhz, I saw the error this patch corrects.
With the patch, the error went away, but the interface is still unstable 
under load.

Lowering down to 32Mhz, without the patch there are no errors.
