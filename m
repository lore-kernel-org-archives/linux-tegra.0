Thanks!

I don't think I need (2). But I don't think I can use (1) as is either. 
I can use (1) with some additional code in my set rate op.

While set rate is in progress, both the parents might need to stay 
enabled for a short duration. So, in my internal set rate, I need to 
check if my clock is prepared/enabled and call prepare/enable on the 
"old parent", call __clk_reparent (which will reduce the ref count for 
the old parents and increase it for the new parents), finish the 
reparent in HW and then unprepare/disable the old parent if I have 
prepared/enabled them earlier.

It might be beneficial to provide something like a 
__clk_reparent_start(new_parent, *scratch_pointer) and 
__clk_reparent_finish(*scratch_pointer) if it will be useful for more 
than just MSM. Based on this email, I would guess that Tegra would want 
something similar too.

Thanks,
Saravana
