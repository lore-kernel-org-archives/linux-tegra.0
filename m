Agreed, it very counter-intuitive. I have a board w/o an invert and it
does look odd with active-low in the dts. It really should be active-high.

The (new) binding helps a bit though.

But that said, for various reasons I ended up not using that binding anyway
and instead rely on polling the internal register for the ACOK bit.

It's a little bit more than a proposal since it is in linux-next. But not set
in stone of course. I personally do not care as long as it is changed before
hitting Linus' tree as I have no deployed devices. But docs are just that.
Docs. Anything that worked before is going to break with the change you are
proposing. Are you really willing to break who knows how many tegra boards?

What will you do a few months down the line when the regression reports start
to creep in??? Argue about it with Linus? And then revert and create an even
bigger mess? You could skip the arguing step and revert right away, but how
is that helpful?

Or do you somehow know that *all* tegra users will always update their kernel
and dtb in sync, so that regressions will not happen?

Changing this is trivial. Testing that the change does what it is supposed to
is not the main obstacle...
