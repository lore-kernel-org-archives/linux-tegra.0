The irqchip needs to keep track how many times request_irq() has been
called, cfr. your suggestion above.

On the other side, the system needs to keep track how many times request_irq()
has been called for each irqchip, so it can subtract those numbers from the
irqchip's counters during suspend of the device, and re-add them during resume.
So we need at least a "struct device *" parameter for request_irq().
devm_request_irq() already has that, but not all drivers use that.

However, I think this should be looked at into the context of "[RFD]
Functional dependencies between devices".
https://lwn.net/Articles/662205/
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/27/388

There can be other dependencies than interrupts between devices.
All functions using dependencies need a "struct device *" parameter to
record information.
