I don't really follow this patch description well. It may help if you
fully spelled out the definition of normal behaviour, what the driver
was doing, and what it should be doing (which is presumable what it does
do after this patch).

What user-visible impact does this patch have. Does it solve a bug, or
improve performance, or ...? In other words, how would I test this
patch, other that testing for regressions in SPI functionality that I
know already works.

BTW, I don't think you're using get_maintainer.pl, since Mark Brown is
the SPI maintainer now, not Grant Likely.

Do you really need a separate write call there? The value of command1
isn't fully set up there (the CS bits are all set up immediately after),
so won't that glitch the CS lines in some cases?

What if !t->len, but t->tx_buf || t->rx_buf ?

This code is also duplicated in tegra_spi_transfer_one_message() after
this patch. Instead, perhaps the first N lines of
tegra_spi_start_transfer_one() should be split out into e.g.
tegra_spi_setup_transfer_one(), such that
tegra_spi_transfer_one_message() can always call it, plus have
tegra_spi_transfer_one_message() only call
tegra_spi_start_transfer_one() if (t->len != 0).
