From: Thierry Reding <treding@nvidia.com>

Changes to the pad controller device tree binding have required that
each lane be associated with a separate PHY. Update the PCI host bridge
device tree binding to allow each root port to define the list of PHYs
required to drive the lanes associated with it.

Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>

Changes in v4:
- add additional lanes subnode when dereferencing PHYs from the XUSB pad
  controller to reflect changes in its binding
