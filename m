Yeah, the behaviour is exactly the same - it's not only not wrapping
your content but also reflowing quoted content.

That was more about the continuing issues with mail formatting.

No, it's fine.  It would have been better to have a clearer commit
message but I think the usage makes it reasonably clear in the final

the features we need to properly control devices" is an extremely common
reason for using GPIO chip selects even when hardware support is
available.
