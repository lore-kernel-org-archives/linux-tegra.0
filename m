The problems with the following approach:

 static int tegra30_ahub_runtime_resume(struct device *dev)
 ...
 	regcache_cache_only(ahub->regmap_apbif, false);
 	regcache_cache_only(ahub->regmap_ahub, false);
+	regcache_sync(ahub->regmap_apbif, false);
+	regcache_sync(ahub->regmap_ahub, false);

(or an automated variant of it, whereby regmap automatically does the
sync inside cache_only(false)) are:

1) regcache_sync() doesn't mean "if the cache is dirty, flush the
dirty registers to HW", but rather, "if the cache is dirty, write any
registers that don't match HW defaults to HW". If the HW was in
cache-only mode because simply because clocks were turned off but not
power, then the register values were retained, and the current HW
register values may not be "HW defaults", and you may in fact /need/
to write a value to HW that matches the HW default, yet is different
from the current retained register content.

2) tegra30_ahub_allocate_tx_fifo() does a read-modify-write of a
control register, and may execute when cache_only(true). If that
register was never touched while cache_only(false), which is the case
the first time the r-m-w happens, then there is no cached value, so
the regmap_read() for it will fail. This will either cause
tegra30_ahub_allocate_tx_fifo() to use uninitialized return data from
regmap_read() (if error-checking is missing, which it is), or fail (if
the error-checking were present). Neither is a good choice. Possible
solutions are:

a) Make regmap creation read the initial HW state to use as HW
defaults when the regmap is created. IIRC, this is done for some
regmap configurations but not others. That said, this doesn't seem
correct, since there's no guarantee that the HW state when the regmap
is created /is/ the default HW state.

b) Add a table of HW register defaults. Aside from this issue, there's
no need for this, so I'm not really motivated to do this. Besides, the
number of registers is rather large.

c) Simply put pm_runtime_get()/put() around the body of
tegra30_ahub_allocate_tx_fifo(), which works fine, and was my original
patch.

d) Have regmap_read/write do a pm_runtime_get()/put() themselves. I
know you mentioned this earlier in the thread, but you'd rejected this
approach when I first upstreamed this AHUB driver, and said to rely on
cache_only instead.

I think I still prefer option (c).
