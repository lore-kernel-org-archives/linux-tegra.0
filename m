Yeah, I'm not too sure what is the point of setting the fake mask to
be honest, but you are definitely right that it is a contradiction to
call a DMA function on a device that is not DMA-capable.

Yes - it would just be a 2-liner that should set things properly for
all 64-bit capable controllers.

We would not need patch 1 anymore.

Let me send this and see if it looks better.

Thanks,
