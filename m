IAnd what happens if you run into a deadlock? Do you print "you've lost, 
try changing your kernel config" in some output hidden by a 
splash-screen? ;)

That sounds like the fun with duck typed languages where you have to 
test any and every possible screnario (something which is almost 
impossible) in order to not run into something unexpected.

Anyway, have fun, good luck.
