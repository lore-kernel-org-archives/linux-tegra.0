Yes, I have a v2 with these comments addressed. One concern, though, is 
the part writing to CLK_SOURCE_EMC. If some other driver also wants to 
read this register (MC, likely), we might need to have an API for it in 
the CAR driver. On the other hand, maybe not, since it's only one 
register. Thierry?

Another point is that v2 adds a new API to the MC driver, which also 
doesn't exist yet. The EMC driver can technically work without the MC 
driver (but with a header for MC added), but I'm not sure the result 
would be very useful.

I believe the plan is that Tomeu's EMC code will be integrated into this 
EMC driver once both are ready.
