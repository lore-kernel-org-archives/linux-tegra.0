There's a bunch of existing code using that idiom.

But it's not a bug to use a GPIO as an IRQ source, otherwise we wouldn't
have gpio_to_irq() in the first place.  Feels like we need a backchannel
between gpiolib and the IRQ code to do this.  Or perhaps the drivers
that implement this should be taking care of setting up the GPIO mode?
