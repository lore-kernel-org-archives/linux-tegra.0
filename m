I'm very sorry for being so dense, but what "other constants" must the
entry match?

For reference, here's the entry I'm referring to:

-ventana                        MACH_VENTANA            VENTANA                 2927

... which seems to use the name "ventana" consistently, if that's what
you mean.

I will happily submit the patch, once I understand exactly what needs to
change. Thanks for any enlightenment!
