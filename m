I compiled both versions to try it out. Your version was just 50 bytes 
larger than mine (I assumed that with yours, we would be able to remove 
the top-level pwm/regulator/gpio definitions that are referred by the 
sequence). The question here is do we want to have something more 
DT-ish, or are we trying to save every possible byte in the DT structure?

As Thierry also mentionned, we are trying to provide the same feature 
using the platform interface. I am not sure how we can elegantly support 
both ways through this.

But doesn't it make sense in the current case? The power sequence is 
basically a program that is run by an interpreter. From this 
perspective, it makes more sense to me to have it as a binary field 
rather than a hierarchy of nodes and properties that will be harder to 
parse and will make error detection more complicated. I don't really see 
any practical benefit from turning the steps into sub-nodes, but then 
again I am not so familiar with the DT.
