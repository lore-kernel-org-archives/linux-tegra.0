On Tegra, the following use cases need specific IOVA mapping.
1. Few MMIO blocks need IOVA=PA mapping setup.
2. CPU side loads the firmware into physical memory, which has to be
mapped to a specific IOVA address, as  firmware is statically linked based
 on specific IOVA address. 

DMA api's allow specifying only one address space per platform device.

For #1, DMA API can't be used as it doesn't allow mapping specific IOVA to PA.
IOMMU API can be used for mapping specific IOVA to PA. But, in order to use
 IOMMU API, the driver has to  dereference the dev pointer, get domain ptr,
 take lock, and allocate memory from dma_iommu_mapping.  This breaks
 the abstraction for struct device. Each device driver that need IOVA=PA has to
 do this, which is redundant.

For #2, physical memory allocations alone can be done through DMA as it also 
allocates IOVA space Implicitly. Even after allocating physical memory through
DMA API's, it would have same problem as #1 for IOVA to PA mapping.

If a fake device is expected to be created for specific IOVA allocation, then it
may  lead to creating multiple fake devices per specific IOVA and per 
ASID(unique IOVA address space).  As domain init would be done based on
device name, the fake device should have the same name as of original platform
device.

If DMA API allows allocating specific IOVA address and mapping IOVA to specific PA,
 device driver don't need to know any details of struct device and specifying
 one mapping per device is enough and no  need for fake devices.

Comments are much appreciated.
