+1.

Grrr, I just wasted a whole morning bisecting the same issue as reporte=
d
above and can confirm the revert is the right thing to do.

Well, almost: the box almost suspends until I hear the clicking sound o=
f
the mainboard trying to turn stuff off but then the fan remains on. Whe=
n
I hit a button on the keyboard, it then turns off completely. This is
probably some nasty BIOS SMI crap which we don't have control over and
I'd guess unrelated to the issue at hand.

Anyway, Rafael, I was wondering: I have a couple of boxes here and it
would probably make a good sense to help out with testing this stuff
more - I just can't have suspend breakages.

Maybe you'd like me to give a run of your tree now and then to check
whether someone has sent you a quickly rushed brownpaper bag of
questionable nature and we can fish it out before it hits Linus. :)

So let me know.

Thanks.
