It's going to probe Y at late_initcall, then probe X when its driver
is registered. No deferred probes nor messages about it.

But if you meant to write the opposite case (X built-in and Y in a
module), then I have to ask you in what situation that would make
sense.

Sorry about that, I have checked that only now and I "only" get 39
deferred probe messages on exynos5250-snow.

I don't think that the number of registered drivers affects the number
of probes that get deferred (but I'm not sure why you mention that).

I was talking about messages if we log each -EPROBE_DEFER, not devices
that remain to be probed. The point being that right now we don't have
a way to know if we are deferring because the dependency will be
around later, or if we have a problem and the dependency isn't going
to be there at all.

If we had a way to enable printing the cause of each -EPROBE_DEFER,
right now that would print 39 messages of this board that are only due
to ordering. The actual issue would be printed in exactly the same way
somewhere in the middle.

Yes, I don't think it makes any sense to measure boot times with the
serial console on, because it's not comparable to production and
because printing an additional line during boot affects significantly
the times.

To be clear, I was saying that this series should NOT affect total
boot times much.

Agreed, with the note from above on why it would be better to only
print such a message only when the -EPROBE_DEFER is likely to be a
problem.

If you really think anything in this series is complex, you should
look at the other ones that tried to accomplish the same!
