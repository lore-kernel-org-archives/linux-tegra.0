Are there real use-cases where that really happens? I guess if we need
that the correct thing would be to bitwise AND both the DMA mask of the
IOMMU device (as set by the driver) with that derived from the IOMMU's
parent bus' dma-ranges property.

Interesting. If a DMA buffer is allocated using the master's DMA mask
wouldn't that cause breakage if the IOMMU and master's DMA masks don't
match. It seems to me like the right thing to do for buffer allocation
is to use the IOMMU's DMA mask if a device uses the IOMMU for
translation and use the device's DMA mask when determining to what I/O
virtual address to map that buffer.

Obviously if we always assume that IOMMU hardware is sane and can always
access at least the whole memory then this isn't an issue. But what if a
device can do DMA to a 64-bit address space, but the IOMMU can only
address 32 bits. If the device's DMA mask is used for allocations, then
buffers could reside beyond the 4 GiB boundary that the IOMMU can
address, so effectively the IOMMU wouldn't be able to write to those
buffers.
