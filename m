You can wrap a regular mainline kernel with the verified boot block
and load it without u-boot. I do it all the time on x86, ARM is no
different.

The main reason for using u-boot is so that you get a command line,
can do network-based booting, bootloader configuration scripts, and so
on.

So, it's not a useful workaround, unfortunately. :(
