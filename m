Sure, I'll address the Viresh's review comments in the v2 that I'll probably
prepare and send out later today. I'll also add another minor-cleanup patch to
the series that removes unnecessary brackets in the code.

Thierry / Jon, please let me if there is anything you disagree-with in the
series as I'd like to avoid re-sending multiple times.

Thanks.
