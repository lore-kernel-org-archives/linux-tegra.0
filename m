That's right. New revision on the way.

That was the way I did it initially, but it has been pointed out that
doing so would require to have #address-cells and #size-cells in every
power sequence, as well as a "reg" property in every step (see
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/31/454 ). Although I'd prefer to use the
@ notation too (and neither dtc nor the kernel complained when I did
it), I tend to think the current solution is less burdensome than
having these redundant properties.

That's another long story. But to make it short, I'd like to make it
possible for power sequences to be referenced and shared between
devices of the same type (as everybody knows, copy/pasting is bad). If
we use phandles in steps, the power sequence becomes tied to the
referred resources and thus cannot be shared with another instance of
the same device. On the other hand, using an identifier that is
resolved at runtime (through e.g. regulator_get(device *, char *)
leverages the existing frameworks and makes things more flexible.

GPIO is currently the exception. It is the only framework for which
you cannot currently resolve a resource from a device and an
identifier. So at the moment we have to use a phandle - but we are
also working with Linus Walleij to provide an alternative GPIO API
that will be more like what we have for regulators/pinctrl/PWM/etc.

Another problem with phandles is that some of the functions that
resolve them are not publicly exported (i.e. AFAIK there is no public
function that returns a regulator from a phandle - the only to obtain
one is through regulator_get)

This is already clearly be defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/, isn't it?

Thanks,
Alex.
