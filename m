I can certainly do that.

"compatible" suggests that a driver would bind to it. However the data real=
ly
is only passed to the DC driver for configuration.

I haven't played around with HDMI at all yet, so I don't know of the
requirements. I'm pretty sure the above isn't anywhere near complete
though.

That's an interesting approach. I like it.

I think I understand where you're going with this. Does the following look
more correct?

	disp1 : dc@54200000 {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-dc";
		reg =3D <0x54200000, 0x00040000>;
		interrupts =3D <0 73 0x04>;
	};

	disp2 : dc@54240000 {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-dc";
		reg =3D <0x54240000, 0x00040000>;
		interrupts =3D <0 74 0x04>;
	};

	drm {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-drm";

		lvds {
			compatible =3D "...";
			dc =3D <&disp1>;
		};

		hdmi {
			compatible =3D "...";
			dc =3D <&disp2>;
		};
	};

Yes, that might be a good idea.

Actually the code does zero out platform_data in tegra_drm_remove(). In fact
I did test module unloading and reloading and it works properly. But it
should probably be zeroed in case drm_platform_init() fails as well.

I prefer my approach over storing the data in an extra field because the
device platform_data field is where everybody would expect it. Furthermore
this wouldn't be relevant if we decided not to support non-DT setups.
