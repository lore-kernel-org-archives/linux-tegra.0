IIRC (because that was a while ago already) having a Tegra-only display 
framework is exactly what we wanted to avoid in the first place. This series 
does nothing but leverage the callbacks mechanism that already exists in pwm-
backlight and make it available to DT systems. If we start making a Tegra-
specific solution, then other architectures will have to reinvent the wheel 
again. I really don't think we want to go that way.

These patches only makes slight changes to pwm_bl.c and do not extend its 
capabilities. I agree that a suitable solution will require the CDF, but by 
the meantime, let's go for the practical route instead of repeating the same 
mistakes (i.e. architecture-specific frameworks) again.

There are certainly better ways to do this, but I'm not convinced at all that 
a Tegra-only solution is one of them.

Alex.
