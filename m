Thanks *a lot* for taking care of this Alexandre! From a quick look at
the patches they seem generally fine. I'll go over them in a bit more
detail though.

Maybe a good option would be to just not implement get_modes() if the
same information can be retrieved via EDID. That is, the DRM driver
could just go and fetch EDID when the nvidia,ddc-i2c-bus is available
(or parse the nvidia,edid blob) and only rely on CDF otherwise.

So for Ventana the only reason why we need CDF is basically the power
sequencing, right?

I definitely think that we should aim for correct panel and backlight
interaction. Perhaps this could work by looking up the real backlight
via it's phandle and have the CDF driver use the backlight API to
disable or enable the backlight as part of the power sequencing.

I'm not sure what you mean by "cannot ignore FB events"? Can you provide
a concrete problematic use-case?

Hijacking .update_status() sounds a bit risky. But perhaps you could
wrap the real backlight in a CDF backlight to receive notifications.
Obviously you'd get two backlight devices in sysfs, but that turn out
not to be a problem.
