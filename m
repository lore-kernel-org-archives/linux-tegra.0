Tolerance is chip specific and info regarding this is part of chip data.
Explained it here to set context for adjusting baud rates based on slave de=
vice
as below. Slave device clock might not be accurate and if the actual clock =
of
slave device would end up out of tolernace range then we will see frame err=
ors.
