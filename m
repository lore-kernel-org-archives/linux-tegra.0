I assume you meant "normally *active* low", not "normally low"?

That sounds like exactly the glitch I was talking about.

Assuming CS isn't held constantly asserted (low), isn't CS de-asserted
(rises) at the end of transaction n-1, and re-asserted (falls) at the
start of transaction n? If so, I'm not sure why the setup for
transaction n needs to both de-assert and then re-assert it? It seems
like cs_control should be handled at the end of a transaction, not at
the start of the next one.
