I'm not sure virtual regulator for CPU is a good idea, in addition to 
that, we don't have a single SoC OPP table, we need several which are 
speedo-id and process-id dependant, but generic cpufreq-cpu0 is assuming 
there is only one statically, for some SoC the frequency table is not 
fixed, they are created at runtime combining our fast and slow CPU 
frequency table and dvfs table. So I'm really not sure is it worth 
adding so many tweaks in order to use the generic cpufreq-cpu0 driver.
