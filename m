I've looked at Marek's patches but I don't think they'll work for Tegra 2 or
Tegra 3. The corresponding iommu_map() functions only set one PTE, regardle=
ss
of the number of bytes passed to them. However, the Tegra TRM indicates that
mapping needs to be done on a per-page basis so contiguous regions cannot be
combined. I suppose the IOMMU driver would have to be fixed to program more
than a single page in that case.

Also this doesn't yet solve the vmap() problem that is needed for the kernel
virtual mapping. I did try using dma_alloc_writecombine(), but that only
works for chunks of 2 MB or smaller, unless I use init_consistent_dma_size()
during board setup, which isn't provided for in a DT setup. I couldn't find
a better alternative, but I admit I'm not very familiar with all the VM API=
s.
Do you have any suggestions on how to solve this? Otherwise I'll try and dig
in some more.

Thierry
