Some devices have configurable IRQ output polarities. Software might
use IRQ specifier flag bits[3:0] to determine how to configure such a
device's IRQ output polarity in order to match how the IRQ controller
input is configured. If the board or SoC inverts the signal between the
device's IRQ output and controller's IRQ output, software must be
aware of this fact, in order to program the IRQ output to the correct
(i.e. opposite) polarity. This flag provides that information.
