This comment does no seem to relate to my patch. We could certainly
re-architect U-Boot to work this way. There are  lot of reasons why
U-Boot works as it does and many platforms don't have SPL.

Relating what you said to the current U-Boot, your item (2) is
analogous to us not setting up driver model before relocation at all,
and just having a debug UART. That's a huge topic though, well beyond
the scope of my original patch. I think it would be better for you to
start a thread on the U-Boot mailing list with your proposal. At least
on x86 (which has no SPL) there are all sorts of things that currently
happen before relocation.

Simon
