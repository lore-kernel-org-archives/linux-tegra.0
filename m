You're right. Back when the burning sun of July was beating down a little bit 
too hard on my head.

The idea that we had was to use preprocessor support in DTC to use macros 
instead of strings for the step type. We also thought about using phandles 
directly in there as well, but this would require some more API support.

Anyway, at the current point we are not even sure whether we want or need 
power seqs in the DT - so let's keep this topic on hold for a while. We can 
still introduce the feature without DT support, and if it eventually turns out 
during this winter that expressing power seqs in the DT makes sense, we will 
have plenty of archives to read in front of the fire.

Alex.
