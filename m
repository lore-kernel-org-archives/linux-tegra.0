Indeed, that would be very useful.

You need to enable the driver in Device Drivers -> Generic Thermal sysfs 
driver -> Tegra SOCTHERM thermal management. Then, you should see 
directories appear in /sys/class/thermal. You can also use the `tmon' 
tool included in the kernel tree to quickly see values; that's what I 
use for testing.
