This sounds better!

Yes, we can do something like this. But i prefer that we first add
support for more platforms and then according to the requirements we can
work out something.

Yes, it should succeed if the framework is not enabled. The drivers
should handle the case of whether the framework is enabled or not when
icc_get() or of_icc_get() returns NULL. Based on that they should decide
if can continue without interconnect support or not.
