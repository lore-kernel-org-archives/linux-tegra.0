What is the plan for fixing things here?  It's not obvious (at least to
me) that we don't want to have the subsystems having knowledge of how
they are bound to a specific firmware which is what you seem to imply
here.  That seems like it's going to fall down since the different
firmware interfaces do have quite different ideas about how things fit
together at a system level and different compatibility needs which do
suggest that just trying to do a direct mapping from DT into ACPI may
well not make people happy but it sounds like that's the intention.

When it gets to drivers the situation is much more clear since it's
normally just simple properties, it's generally a bit more worrying if
drivers are needing to directly interact with cross-device linkage.
This is all subsystem level code though.

It seems like we're going to have to refactor these bits of code when
they get generalised anyway so I'm not sure that the additional cost
here is that big.
