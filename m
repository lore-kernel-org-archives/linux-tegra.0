Most of these can't be made tristate as-is, because they use symbols
that aren't exported. Many of those symbols can easily be exported, so
its just a matter of getting the respective patches merged. I disagree
with making the modules non-unloadable, though. I have a local branch
with changes necessary to unload the host controller driver and it
works just fine.
