That is the plan, we just never made a lot of progress here.

Agreed.

Again, this is what I'm doing here, unfortunately we cannot remove the
sysdata pointer altogether as we still have over a hundred existing PCI
host bridge implementations that all use sysdata.

Exactly.

Can you clarify that? I don't see what prevents two drivers from each
creating a pci_host_bridge structure and passing it into
pci_host_bridge_register().

In my initial version, it simply became unnecessary because all callers
of pci_host_bridge_register() would have to allocate it anyway, and with
the pci_bus assignment gone, it didn't do much at all.

That's why I suggested doing this in the allocation function now.

I was trying to preserve the existing behavior, this can probably
be simplified, but as my initial version was completely untested
I decided not to touch it.

Later in the function, the list is filled one entry at a time from
the local 'resources' list that we traditionally passed as a function
argument before.

Ideally we'd just walk the list instead of doing the
split/list_del/list_add dance, and this would be a logical
cleanup on top of this patch.

This is why I left the list handling you mentioned above unchanged
in my original patch instead of rewriting it.

That should be possible, I guess Thierry can deal with that when respinning
the series.
