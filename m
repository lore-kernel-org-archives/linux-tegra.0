The LED of the CPU Vdd indicates the power of CPU cluster. But the
series of CPU idle power down mode support for Tegra114 only supports
per core power down. It did not support cluster power down yet in idle
mode. That needs some extra work to support cluster power down in idle
mode.
There are some items that I plat to do:
1. integrate the MCPM (multi cluster power management) code into Tegra
CPU PM code
2. integrate coupled CPUidle framework into Tegra CPU idle driver
3. normalize the Tegra CPU idle driver to single one

Actually I didn't add anything about hotplug or something can increase
the loading or make regressions. But I think you are testing with USB
device attached, right? That might cause some extra loading. You can
give it a try after just removing USB device. And I double confirm that
on Seaboard. Except that, the test result looks OK for me.

I have tested all these patches based on next-20130716. And verified the
functions on Seaboard, Cardhu and Dalmore. Looks good for me. And the
per core power down in idle is OK too. The cluster power down only
support when the system goes into suspend mode right now for Tegra114.

Thanks,
Joseph
