Sorry for delay! I have now looked into this in more detail.

When an genpd provider is added today, it's supposed to get a
corresponding *unique* OF device node associated with it, right!?

If we store this OF device node from the provider in the struct
generic_pm_domain, instead of the "provider_data pointer", we wouldn't
need to the add of_genpd_del_provider_by_data() at all. Because we can
use the currently available of_genpd_del_provider(), right!?

Or what am I missing? :-)

Kind regards
Uffe
