I understand. Perhaps it should be added to the pci_enable_resources()
function?

The patch was on top of this series, which in turn is based on -next.
However the patch doesn't actually change anything in the ordering of
the initialization sequence, it just replaces the ARM implementation
of pcibios_enable_device() to reuse pci_enable_resources().

ARM's main PCI entry point, arch/arm/kernel/bios32.c:pci_common_init(),
does call the correct sequence: pci_bus_assign_resources() followed by
pci_bus_add_devices(), so the sequence looks correct. However, judging
by the logs Stephen posted, the BAR assignment is too late, after the
driver has been probed.

Right. I don't think this can happen. If the bridge hasn't been probed,
then the devices shouldn't be there anyway.
