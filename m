I wasn't "too busy".  I had walked away from all kernel maintanence in
disgust at the way many in the ARM community ignores questions, and
ignores patches which need testing - I'm talking there about the L2C
patch series which was extremely poorly tested, and still, to this day,
has questions outstanding.  Yes, the code now produces warnings.  It
produces warnings /because/ people were not willing to help.

Those warnings serve as a reminder that there's still problems which
need solving there, and they're not going to go away until those
problems are solved.

While I don't like pushing unfinished code into mainline, in this case,
others deemed the patch set too important _not_ to go into mainline
even with these problems.

Now, it's been /soo/ long since I worked on that patch set that my
knowledge has now diminished... so it's now going to be _much_ harder
to resolve those issues than it would have been three months ago.

And I'm also holding a grudge, and I bear grudges for a long time, so
expect me to be "difficult" towards Linux stuff for a while yet.

The formatting problem I refer to above is line 1532/1533 in sdhci.c -
there's an additional blank line which somehow got left behind, caused
presumably by insufficient attention paid to cleaning up a conflict
between my original patches and the state of the tree they were
applied to.
