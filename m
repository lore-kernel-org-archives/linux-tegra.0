+1. I've been very behind on email lately and I haven't paid enough
attention to this, but I'd like to see this go in for 3.16 as well,
and it shouldn't have to go in through each subtree. Sequencing that
in this case would be a huge pain indeed.

It would be better to just keep it all on a shared topic branch that
we can merge into arm-soc as a dependency, so we can resolve merge
conflicts as we merge in from platform maintainers. I wouldn't expect
anything major besides some context conflicts due to nearby edits.

The only thing I am not 100% on is if it's a good idea or not to add
to the machine descriptor, since it'll make it harder to make
descriptor-free generic platforms for A9, but it's a minor detail and
the benefit of the series outweigh that (and we can revisit if truly
needed later).
