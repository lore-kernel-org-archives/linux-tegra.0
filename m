I got the ATAGS from /proc/atags and there is no memory entry there, only 
initrd and cmdline (which is the one from nvflash).

The machine also has a fixup routine, but it also boots without (I'm sure it 
was necessary in the past),

... so I guess this is why it also works with DT.

I tested several variations. Without DT, the fixup can compensate a missing 
mem entry in the kernel command line, but with a mem= from the kernel command 
line, a fixup is not needed.

With DT, the command line specified from nvflash is ignored and the one from 
DT comes into the game. If it is also missing there, system detects 512 MB 
(which is physical right, but we cannot reserve memory for the gpu). The fixup 
is indeed ignored in this case.

I leave this out because the bootloader does not send memory info in the 
ATAGS.

see above. RAM detection works, but it's not what we want ...

Well, I see two options for our case:

	a) use the mem=448M@0 in the DT so the gpu can get its memory
	b) upstream the chromeos changes to reserve gpu memory "on the fly" from 
the autodetected 512M (as it should be IMHO).
