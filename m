Cool, I'd love to see that used in U-Boot as well.

Yes, these are strings we are looking up to know the type of the next 
element to power on/off in the sequence. I don't like these, honestly, 
and would rather have them replaced by constants - however there is no 
way to define constants in the DT AFAIK (but I have heard some other 
persons are interested in having them too), and this is the only way I 
have found to keep the sequence readable.

I see a few problems with this: first, how do you know the types of your 
phandles? At step 0, we should get a regulator, step 1 is a PWM and step 
2 is a GPIO. This is why I have used strings to identify the type of the 
phandle and the number (and type) of additional arguments to parse for a 
step.

Second, I am afraid the representation in memory would be significantly 
bigger since the properties names would have to be stored as well (I am 
no DT expert, please correct me if I am wrong). Lastly, the additional 
freedom of having extra properties might make the parser more complicated.

I agree the type strings are a problem in the current form - if we could 
get constants in the device tree, that would be much better. Your way of 
representing the sequences is interesting though, if we can solve the 
type issue (and also evaluate its cost in terms of memory footprint), it 
would be interesting to consider it as well.

Alex.
