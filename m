Because loading/initializing on demand doesn't give you any solved order 
of drivers to initialize. And it can't because it has no idea about the 
requirements of other drivers. The reason why it might work better in 
the case of the tegra is that it might give you another initialization 
order than the one which is currently choosen, which, by luck, might be 
a better one.

But maybe I missed something, I haven't looked at the patches at all. 
But just loading on demand, can't magically give you a working order of 
drivers to initialize. E.g. how do you choose the first driver to 
initialize?
