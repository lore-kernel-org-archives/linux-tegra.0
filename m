These kind of changes it requires are consuming a bit more time than
I was hoping for.

So maybe at this very moment the best is reverting the patch.

I have some patches that would move towards that goal in
baby steps without having to resort to a big rewrite at
this very moment.

Maybe Jon can check each patch one after another to see if any is 
producing the unexpected behavior and only then you would include
them...

As for the root cause of the regression: my guess is that spi-mem is
just not triggering a shutdown any more because of how message_pump works.

The improvement of the state-machine can then get addressed
separately.
