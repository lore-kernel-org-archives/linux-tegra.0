The bindings are fine.

The Tegra dts files are buggy, but the driver is also buggy, so those
two bugs cancel each other. So, the option is to either introduce
regressions by fixing the two bugs thus creating a flag day where
the kernel and dt needs to match. Or, just document what is going on
and change the bindings even if they are not wrong.

I suggest you read the discussion. We covered all this already, and it
is also in the commit message.

Cheers,
