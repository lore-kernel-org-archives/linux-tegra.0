The APB DMA controller node needs a clocks property. The same goes for
I2C and KBC. I'd like to avoid merging those 3 patches until the
Tegra114 clock patches are present, since the nodes won't be useful
until then anyway. I expect the clock patches will be merged in 3.10.

Related, the I2C driver appears to need updates since the HW isn't 100%
backwards-compatible. I would prefer not to apply the patch adding DT
nodes for I2C until the relevant driver patches are also posted and
checked in. That said, Wolfram said he applied the Tegra114 I2C patch on
1/24, although I don't see it in next-20130128; perhaps he simply didn't
push out his next branch to the git server yet?

I think the other patches are all OK, so I'll apply them to Tegra's
for-3.9/soc-t114 branch.
