In some cases, yes. However, some of the clock structs and ops variables
are re-used by multiple clock types in different files. For example,
struct tegra_clk_periph aggregates a struct tegra_clk_frac_div and a
struct tegra_clk_periph_gate. That means that at least some of the types
and ops variables must be declared in clk.h (or some header anyway). As
such, I'd rather just have all the types and ops variables declared
there for consistency.

It avoids a compiler warning; the compiler doesn't that the if condition
that guards the path that uses flags is the same condition as the path
that initializes it. Or, it may be related to the fact that
spin_lock_irqsave() writes to the value through a pointer parameter, and
the compiler doesn't know it's an out-only parameter.

Sure. I moved all "to_clk_*()" macros to clk.h for consistency, since
the types are all there anyway.

I've already fixed all those up locally.

Stack variables aren't initialized in C. In this case, since the
individual fields are being assigned via statements rather than an
initializer, everything has to be done explicitly.

Meh. Do you feel strongly about this? I'm not really inclined to got
through and change these; there are a bunch of similar things in other
files, and it feels like it'd just be churn.

Anything I didn't explicitly say no to, I have implemented.

A /lot/ more of the original patch was quoted that was really necessary
to make your comments; it made wading through the email a little tiresome.
