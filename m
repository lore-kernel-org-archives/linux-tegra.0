IMO the driver should know whether is needs multiple power-domains or 
not and if it needs multiple then it should just call 
dev_pm_domain_attach_by_id() N times without needing to checking 
dev->pm_domain first. If it fails then either the PM domain core did 
something wrong or power-domains are missing from DT, but either way 
there is an error, so let it fail.
