Overall this change looks OK. However, since it encodes aspects of the 
DT binding (i.e. that the per-port nodes have a phys property in the new 
scheme), I think it can't be applied until the related DT binding change 
is accepted.

Rather than re-parsing DT to determine this, thus duplicating the logic, 
can't the code store some flag in tegra_pcie_phys_get() indicating which 
path was taken, and that flag used here? Perhaps that flag could be 
based on whether pcie->phy is set, although the else block here implies 
that particular solution won't work.
