Chris,

I think patches 3 and 4 of this series can go through either the MMC
tree (I checked there are no conflicts with the MMC patch I have to take
through the Tegra tree), or the Tegra tree (since I'm taking another
Tegra MMC patch though there), both without any dependency issues.

It's your call. Let me know if you want me to take them through the
Tegra tree with an ack. Or, if you want to take them through the MMC
tree that's fine too. If you need them reposted to see the content, let
me know, or they're at:

http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/222136/
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/222138/

Thanks.
