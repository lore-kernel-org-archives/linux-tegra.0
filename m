I saw you introducing the "mmc_of_parse" API here. It looks pretty
similar to the "sdhci_get_of_property" that under
"drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-pltfm.c". Does this function can be enhanced in
"sdhci_get_of_property" or replaced it? Or its use for different DT
property bindings, one is for mmc (you introduced here), the other is
for sdhci. Just curious, how do I determine which one should I use in
the sdhci/mmc host driver?

And after this one "[PATCH/RFC] mmc: add DT bindings for more MMC
capability flags", some of the properties parsing were overlap and some
were not. If the host driver uses the standard property but it was being
separated to these two different of_parse function, I need to call both
of them. Sorry, I am not sure the sdhci and mmc do have different
specific properties and should separate to two different functions.

Thanks,
Joseph
