That's as quick as I expected it to show up, so that's great. I don't
suppose you could mail Wei and myself once the patch gets into the
linux-wireless tree, so we can test it out on Tegra. If the patch could
possibly go into a topic branch in the wireless tree so it can be merged
into the Tegra tree before this series, that would be awesome. Thanks.
