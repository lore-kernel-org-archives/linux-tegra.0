The way it works on pSeries is that upon VM creation, the guest is assigned
one 256MB window for use by assigned DMA capable devices. When the guest
creates a mapping, it uses a hypercall to associate a bus address in that
range with a guest physical address. The hypervisor checks that the bus
address is within the allowed range, and translates the guest physical
address into a host physical address, then enters both into the I/O page
table or I/O TLB.

These dma-ranges properties would almost always be for the entire RAM,
and we can treat anything else as a bug.

The mapping between what goes into the IOMMU and what comes out of it
is not reflected in DT at all, since it only happens at runtime.
The dma-ranges property I mean above describes how what comes out of
the IOMMU maps into physical memory.

My reasoning was that the DT should specify whether we use the IOMMU
or not. Being able to just switch on or off the IOMMU sounds nice as
well, so we could change the text above to do that.

Another option would be to do this in the IOMMU code, basically
falling back to the IOMMU parent's dma-ranges property and using
linear dma_map_ops when that is disabled.

The one case  where that doesn't work is PCI, because we don't list the
PCI devices in DT normally, and the iommus property would only exist
at the PCI host controller node.
