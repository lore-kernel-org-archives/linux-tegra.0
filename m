All this brings the discussion back to the root of the problem: irqchips
(and timers) are not first class devices, because we need them too early
for that.

I'd really like to solve this, but the kernel init is incredibly
complicated, and the subsystem dependencies completely undocumented. It
looks like we need the timer early because the we fork a thread for
PID-1, and the scheduler is going to need some form of tick.

So ideally, we'd be able to move the irq/timer stuff *after* the device
framework (which itself requires devtmpfs to be up and running, hence
dragging the whole VM and VFS), but before the scheduler is initialized.
I'm sure there is plenty of other dependencies I haven't worked out yet.

If anyone has some spare time and willing to help, please speak now! ;-)

Thanks,

	M.
