I like the concept (I have been thinking along similar lines lately).
But I think this might make the console messages more confusing than
they are now.  The problem is that debug, warn, and error messages
come from a somewhat random set of locations at the moment.  Some
come from the driver probe routines and some come from the subsystems
that the probe routines call.  So the patch is suppressing some
messages, but not others.

One thing that seemed pretty obvious from the patches is that the
current probe routines are somewhat inconsistent in terms of messages,
and that there is room for a set of best practices for messaging.  That
is on my long term wish list, but I'm not sure I'll ever chase after
those windmills.

A couple of specific comments below.

The places where dev_warn_deferred() replaces dev_dbg(), we lose the
ability to turn on debugging and observe the driver reporting the
specific reason the deferral is occurring. So it would be useful to
add an "else dev_dbg()" in dev_warn_deferred() to retain that capability.

Couldn't you put the "driver_deferred_probe_report = true" here?  And then
not add another round of probes.
