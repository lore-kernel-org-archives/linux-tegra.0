Yes, but it wasn't like a direct request, say "We need your input, so c=
an you
please have a look and BTW we want this in 4.4, so please do it ASAP". =
 In
which case I'd prioritize that before other things I needed to take car=

It is similar in some ways.  For example, if a device's functionality d=
epends
on an I2C resource (connection), the core doesn't know that at the devi=
ce
creation time at least in some cases.  Same for GPIO, SPI, DMA engines =
etc.

There is a _DEP object in ACPI that can be used by firmware to tell the=
 OS
about those dependencies, but there's no way in the driver core to use =
that
information anyway today.

The probe ordering is not the entire picture, though.

Even if you get the probe ordering right, the problem is going to show =
up in
multiple other places: system suspend/resume, runtime PM, system shutdo=
wn,
unbinding of drivers.  In all of those cases it is necessary to handle =
things
in a specific order if there is a dependency.

The "that happened to be created by DT" part is of concern here.  What =
is there
that makes DT special in that respect?  Why shouldn't that be applicabl=
e to
devices created by the ACPI core, for example, or by a board file or so=
mething
else?

ACPI uses platform devices too.  In fact, ACPI device objects are enume=
rated as
platform devices by default now.

Or do you means something else here?

It explains the context of the series, so it is useful to talk about IM=
O.

OK, so maybe I misunderstood you, sorry about that.
