Hello,

This patch-series integrates the GART (IOMMU) driver with the Memory
Controller driver, that allows to report the name of a faulty memory
client on GART page fault. A major code clean up and performance
optimization is performed in this series as well.

Changelog:

v5: Addressed review comments from Thierry Reding to v4. Added WARN_ON() to
    make sure that active domain isn't getting released, kept include headers
    where necessary, etc.. All changes are quite minor.

    Added new patch "memory: tegra: Use relaxed versions of readl/writel".

v4: In the v3 Rob Herring requested to make device-tree binding changes
    backwards-compatible with the older kernels, that is achieved by
    changing the 'compatible' value of the DT node.

    The code-refactoring patches got some more (minor) polish.

    Added new patch "memory: tegra: Use of_device_get_match_data()".

v3: Memory Controller integration part has been reworked and now GART's
    device-tree binding is changed. Adding Rob Herring for the device-tree
    changes reviewing.

    GART now disallows more than one active domain at a time.

    Fixed "spinlock recursion", "NULL pointer dereference" and "detaching
    of all devices from inactive domains".

    New code-refactoring patches.

    The previously standalone patch "memory: tegra: Don't invoke Tegra30+
    specific memory timing setup on Tegra20" is now included into this
    series because there is a dependency on that patch and it wasn't applied
    yet.

v2: Addressed review comments from Robin Murphy to v1 by moving devices
    iommu_fwspec check to gart_iommu_add_device().

    Dropped the "Provide single domain and group for all devices" patch from
    the series for now because after some more considering it became not
    exactly apparent whether that is what we need, that was also suggested
    by Robin Murphy in the review comment. Maybe something like a runtime
    IOMMU usage for devices would be a better solution, allowing to implement
    transparent context switching of virtual IOMMU domains.

    Some very minor code cleanups, reworded commit messages.
