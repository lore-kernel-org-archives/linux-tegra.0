The problem with this approach is that since the control registers are
within the AFI register range, both the reg and ranges properties of the
parent would have to include these holes. Furthermore it means that the
controller driver would have to remap the AFI registers in chunks, for the
sole reason of splitting out the controle registers.

Would it be acceptable to make an exception in this case and use the port's
second reg entry as an offset into the AFI register range instead?
