Most Renesas SoCs have module clocks, which we model as a clock domain.
Some Renesas SoCs have power domains for CPUs, others have them for
devices as well.
As we always provide a virtual "always-on" power domain in the power domain
controller, all devices can refer to it using "power-domains" properties,
and the driver for the power domain controller can just forward the clock
domain operations to the clock driver.
