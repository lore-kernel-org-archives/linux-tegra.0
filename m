Nope. E.g. for alpha architecture, HAVE_CLK is not set and without
COMMON_CLK:

drivers/pwm/pwm-meson.o: In function `meson_pwm_init_channels':
(.text+0x244): undefined reference to `devm_clk_register'

I guess other solution would be to add stubs for few clk functions...

Because of !HAS_IOMEM, since some time ARCH=um does not support
COMPILE_TEST. Therefore HAS_IOMEM dependency is not needed for compile
testing (and for regular build it is selected by ARCH).

Since some time !OF has all necessary stubs so OF is actually needed
only for binding, not compiling.
