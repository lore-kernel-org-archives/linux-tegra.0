I don't think it would be possible to write a driver that works for all
device tree based boards or architectures. As you said the implementation is
very hardware specific and probably couldn't even be generalized among two
chipsets of the same architecture.

However there has recently been a lot of work to move out arch-specific
drivers for PWM, GPIO and others out of arch/ and into respective directori=
es
below drivers/. The reason I asked was because I think the same could be do=
ne
for PCI/PCIe.
