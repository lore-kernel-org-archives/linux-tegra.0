Hi Stephen,

the way the EMC clock rate is set in hardware is similar to other
clocks, i.e. there's a register and you write the new divider and parent
id to it. However, with EMC, you cannot just do this any time you want;
writing to the register initiates a state machine in the clock hardware
that changes a large number of other parameters regarding DRAM timings
as well. These parameters need to be programmed into shadow registers
before the rate change write is done. This means that both the new
divisor and the parent must be written in the same register write.

The CCF has a callback, set_rate_and_parent, which allows for both to be
passed to the driver at the same time. However, it also requires
set_rate and set_parent to be implemented, which the EMC driver cannot do.

Furthermore, the CCF cannot help with parent selection for the EMC clock
at all. The parent for each rate is selected by the board designer.

There is also the issue that sometimes, the EMC driver cannot directly
switch to the target (rate, parent) pair; instead it is necessary to
switch first to another pair we call a backup timing. In this situation,
we temporarily have a parent that is neither the one we had before the
set_rate call or the one it will be after. Especially, if the switch to
the backup timing succeeds but the following switch to the target timing
fails, then without the reparent call the parent in hardware would be
left inconsistent with the software state.

This is why we've decided to implement the driver with only the set_rate
callback and decide the required transitions within the driver.
This also means that the driver needs to have a function to tell the CCF
that it has changed its parent.

Thanks,
Mikko.
