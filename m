OK, I see why there's no race. It still seems simply to me if
tegra_slink_clear_status() just always writes all the status bits, but I
suppose it isn't a correctness issue.

Oh dear. Well, I guess it'll have to be OK then; we'll just have to find
a way of decoupling this API from the mach-tegra directory later:-(
