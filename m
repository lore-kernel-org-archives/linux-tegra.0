It's extra work to switch it over since the assumption is brand new.
It's something we can consider for future platforms but Stephen
dropped that patch like a bomb from a blue sky _after_ the final
versions of firmware had been cut -- or more importantly, tested. So,
we should have this in the kernel at this time.

We've always been developing the linux kernel on embedded platforms
with the mindset that firmware will usually get things wrong at some
point, so the safe thing is to not make assumptions about how it has
configured the hardware and do most of it from scratch in the kernel.
It's how we have handled all tegra pinmux up until now, and doing a
180-degree turn on this now, when there has been no _new_ concerns
that caused this, seems like a complication that is just throwing
everybody in a loop.

The same concerns about conflicting pinmux settings surely exists on
any platform that does muxing. Tegra isn't unique in this way, so I
wonder what is causing the need to remove this functionality from the
kernel?

I'll be happy to discuss this more off-list w.r.t. future projects
that we can cut over to rely more on firmware pinmux, but the public
mailing list is not the right place for that.
