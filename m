If you try submitting 'flexible' code in other parts of the kernel
without users of this flexibility and no solid arguments why this
flexibility is needed it would most likely be rejected.

Unnecessary flexibility can be a burden, rather than an advantage.

There are multiple benefits, the following shortcomings of the current
approach are eliminated:

- it is error prone and allows governors to do the wrong thing, e.g.
  - start monitoring before the governor is fully ready
  - keep monitoring when the governor is partially 'stopped'
  - omit mandatory calls
- delegates tasks to the governors which are responsibility of the
  core
- code is harder to read
  - switch from common code to governor code and back
- unecessary boilerplate code in governors
- option to replace ->event_handler() with ->start(), ->stop(), etc,
  which is cleaner

I'm easily convinced if the flexibility is really needed. I'm not even
expecting a real world example, just be creative and make something
up that sounds reasonable.

start/resume()
{
	// prepare governor

	// start polling

=>	what needs to be done here that couldn't have been done
=>	before polling was started?
}

stop/suspend()
{
=>	what needs to be done here that couldn't be done after polling
=>	is stopped?

	// stop polling

	// 'unprepare' governor
}

I listed several benefits, please comment on the specific items if you
disagree, instead of just saying there are no benefits.

OTOH so far we haven't seen an even hypothetical example that shows
that the flexibility *could* be needed.

And even if such a rare case that we currently can't imagine came up,
it could be easily addressed with notifiers, a standard mechanism in
the kernel to inform drivers about events they are interested in.
