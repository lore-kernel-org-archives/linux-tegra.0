Yes, we could - that's really what should be happening here.  The other
bit of this is that we're doing it twice which isn't success.

That's not a good reason to encourage bad patterns in drivers.  At the
very least the drivers should be able to pass the same struct into both
places, having to open code the same thing in two places is going to be
error prone.

That does avoid the duplication.  However there are issues with the
interface for enumerable buses, it doesn't solve the problem where
embedded systems need you to power up the device manually prior to the
device actually enumerating.  If we're doing early resource acquisition
we probably want to solve that too.
