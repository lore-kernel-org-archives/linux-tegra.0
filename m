Yes, however, you still get a valid name in /proc/iomem with this
change. I made sure I tested that ...

/ # cat /proc/iomem
6000d000-6000dfff : /gpio@0,6000d000
60020000-600213ff : /dma@0,60020000
700008d4-70000b6f : /pinmux@0,700008d4
70003000-70003293 : /pinmux@0,700008d4
70006000-7000603f : serial
7000d100-7000d1ff : /i2c@0,7000d100
7000e400-7000e7ff : /pmc@0,7000e400
...

The only expection might be the non-DT case, but I am not sure we care
about that for most boards? Hmm ... I wonder if I need to set
"regs.name" for the non-DT case? I probably should ...

I thought about that, but it still seems racy. You probably want to
assign the new base before freeing the old and so you would need another
tmp variable. Even so, I was not sure if there could be a race here.
Ideally, you would lock, but then you need to lock everywhere that you
use base. Given that my patch still provides a /proc/iomem entry with a
valid name, it seems best to me.
