Hello,

I have a problem with the panel on my Tegra Chromebook taking longer th=
an
expected to be ready during boot (St=C3=A9phane Marchesin reported what=
 is
basically the same issue in [0]), and have looked into ordered probing =
as a
better way of solving this than moving nodes around in the DT or playin=
g with
initcall levels.

While reading the thread [1] that Alexander Holler started with his ser=
ies to
make probing order deterministic, it occurred to me that it should be p=
ossible
to achieve the same by registering devices as they are referenced by ot=
her
devices.

This basically reuses the information that is already implicit in the p=
robe()
implementations, saving us from refactoring existing drivers or adding
information to DTBs.

Something I'm not completely happy with is that I have had to move the =
call to
of_platform_populate after all platform drivers have been registered.
Otherwise I don't see how I could register drivers on demand as we don'=
t have
yet each driver's compatible strings.

=46or machs that don't move of_platform_populate() to a later point, th=
ese
patches shouldn't cause any problems but it's not guaranteed that we'll=
 avoid
all the deferred probes as some drivers may not be registered yet.

I have tested this on boards with Tegra, iMX.6 and Exynos SoCs, and the=
se
patches were enough to eliminate all the deferred probes.

With this series I get the kernel to output to the panel in 0.5s, inste=
ad of 2.8s.

Regards,

Tomeu
