In this case there is only one device, so ...

... no that will not work in this case unless we create some sort of
dummy parent device but I was hoping to avoid that.

It is really not too different from how we nest power-domains today. In
fact I can manually nest them and add them to the device in the driver
with the existing genpd APIs. However, I don't have a meaningful way to
describe the power-domains that are used by the device in DT because
there is more than one.
