And there collapses my theory.

Indeed, from your last paragraph this makes even more sense now.

Oh, and I noticed I forgot to reply to this:

That's true - however when dereferencing the phandle, the underlying framework 
will try to acquire the PWM, which will result in failure if the same resource 
is referenced several times.

One could compare the phandles to avoid this, but in your example you must 
know that for PWMs the "xyz" part is not relevant for comparison.

This makes referencing of resources by name much easier to implement and more 
elegant with respect to frameworks leveraging.
