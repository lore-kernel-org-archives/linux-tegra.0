I can confirm this on r8a7791/koelsch:

    PM: suspend entry (deep)
    PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
    Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.010 seconds) done.
    OOM killer disabled.
    Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.009 seconds) done.
    spi_master spi0: could not stop message queue
    spi_master spi0: queue stop failed
    dpm_run_callback(): rspi_suspend+0x0/0xc returns -16
    PM: Device e6b10000.spi failed to suspend: error -16
    PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected

In addition, after boot, when the QSPI device is idle (the only activity
was the initial probe), the device is no longer runtime-suspended, as
witnessed by the following change to
/sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/pm_genpd_summary:

    -    /devices/platform/soc/e6b10000.spi                  suspended
    +    /devices/platform/soc/e6b10000.spi                  active

and by the following change to /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary:

    -             qspi                     0        1        0
97500000          0     0  50000
    -                qspi_mod              0        1        0
97500000          0     0  50000
    +             qspi                     1        1        0
97500000          0     0  50000
    +                qspi_mod              1        1        0
97500000          0     0  50000

Reverting 412e60373245 also fixes that.
