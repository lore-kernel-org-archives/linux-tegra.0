Sorry for being vague: I just meant that the code as it stands in mainline
is better than calling disable_nonboot_cpus(), because the latter seems to
require all the secondary cores to hit the idle loop, notice that they are
not online, and then call cpu_die. We really need this sequence to be
synchronous wrt the CPU initiating the kexec.

I guess this comes down to the different between cpu_die/cpu_kill and
whether you actually need cpu_die if you're not planning on returning to
the same kernel that you left. If you really need to call cpu_die, then we
need to figure out a way to do that whilst ensuring that only one CPU is
left standing at the time we start copying the new kernel into place.
