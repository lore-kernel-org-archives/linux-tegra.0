I remember this case very well and we designed for it, so it should be handled
by pin control and GPIO thusly:

Example: use pins 1,2 as I2C, then convert them to GPIO for a while
then back again:

// This call looks up a map containing pins 1,2 and reserve them
p = pinctrl_get(dev, "i2c");
if (IS_ERR(p))
  ...
pinctrl_enable(p);
pinctrl_disable(p);
// This will free up the pins again
pinctrl_put(p);
// So now we can do this...
// NB: the GPIO driver calls pinctr_request_gpio() to check
// that it can take these pins
gpio_request(1, "gpio1"):
gpio_request(2, "gpio2");
// This will trigger a reset or something
gpio_direction_output(1, 1);
gpio_direction_output(2, 1);
// Release pins again
gpio_free(1);
gpio_free(2);
// Take them back for this function
p = pinctrl_get(dev, "i2c");

It's a bit kludgy but works and makes sure the pins are only used
for one thing at a time.

BTW: Russell, which specific platform and driver was it that had this
usecase? I'd like to have a look at the code to educate myself.

Yours,
