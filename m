Yes, I can imagine what a mess it would become it we had one driver for every 
panel out there which sole purpose would be to define power sequences over more 
generic drivers. That reassures me about the usefulness of this work.

Another (small) benefit of power sequences over specific drivers is that being 
defined in the DT, they would allow an old kernel to operate a newer device if 
the base driver is the same.
