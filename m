So in this case virtualization is the reason why we need the DMA window.
The reason for that is that the guest has no other way of knowing what
other guests might be using, so it's essentially a mechanism for the
host to manage the DMA region and allocate subregions for each guest. If
virtualization isn't an issue then it seems to me that the need for DMA
windows goes away because the operating system will track DMA regions
anyway.

The only reason I can think of why a windowed IOMMU would be useful is
to prevent two or more devices from stepping on each others' toes. But
that's a problem that the OS should already be handling during DMA
buffer allocation, isn't it?

I've gone through the proposal at [0] again, but couldn't find a mention
of an empty "dma-ranges" property. But regardless I think that a 1:1
mapping is the obvious meaning of an empty "dma-ranges" property.

[0]: http://www.openfirmware.org/ofwg/proposals/Closed/Accepted/410-it.txt

One thing I'm not sure about is whether dma-ranges should be documented
in this binding at all. Since there's an accepted standard proposal it
would seem that it doesn't need to be specifically mentioned. One other
option would be to link to the above proposal from the binding and then
complement that with what an empty "dma-ranges" property means.

Or we could possible document this in a file along with other standard
properties. I don't think we currently do that for any properties, but
my concern is that there will always be a limited number of people
knowing about how such properties are supposed to work. If all of a
sudden all these people would disappear, everybody else would be left
with references to these properties but nowhere to look for their
meaning.

Okay, I have a new version of the binding that I think incorporates all
the changes discussed so far. It uses #address-cells and #size-cells to
define the length of the specifier, but if we decide against that it can
easily be changed again.
