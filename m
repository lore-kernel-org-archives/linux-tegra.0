I've seen both cases, and indeed the case sometimes depends on the
target rate of the clock.

For example, when the CPU clock changes, we basically do the following
within set_rate:

* Set CPU clock parent to some "backup" PLL
* Change the CPU PLL to the desired rate
* Set CPU clock parent to the CPU PLL

However, the lowest CPU clock rate we support is actually the rate that
the backup PLL runs at, so if we're targeting that rate, the CPU clock
set_rate /just/ does:

* Set CPU clock parent to some "backup" PLL

and leaves it there, until a different CPU clock rate is requested, at
which time the CPU clock will be re-parented back to the CPU PLL.
