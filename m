I would assume so, yes.

I think it comes down to whether you want to use DMA for that UART or 
not. I don't recall the exact reason why this might be important. 
Perhaps it's one/more of:

- The Tegra-specific DMA-capable driver can't be used for early debug 
but the core 8250 driver can. I don't know if this is true though.

- There are a limited number of DMA channels on Tegra. If all ports 
blindly used DMA simply because the dmas property was included, then 
we'd risk running out of DMA channels for cases where it absolutely had 
to be used; e.g. a low-volume debug console might prevent a high-volume 
MODEM or BT UART from using DMA if they probed in the "wrong" order.

Laxman might be able to shed more light on this.

At least in this case, I'd assume so, yes.

That's a subtly different interpretation of DT compatible usage than was 
given (I think it was by Mitch Bradley???) when this driver was 
introduced. In the conversation then, it was asserted that using 
different compatible values to describe that SW should use a different 
interface to the HW (non-DMA vs. DMA) was exactly in line with the 
semantic concept of compatible.
