I see, but this one is modelling just the ACTMON IP block, which just
gathers statistics and can fire interrupts when some thresholds are
surpassed. Memory bus scaling itself is performed by the EMC driver
(External memory clock).

You are right, in the next version I have removed the OPP data from
the ACTMON node and the driver now uses the CCF API to find out what
frequencies are supported by the EMC clock.
