I think the problem is that you try to mix up responsibility of who
needs to set the DMA mask.  Either we want the core sdhci code set
it as we do, or we move it to the driver, probably optionally.

So instead of trying to read something back you should either:

 - add a set_dma_mask to override it
 - add a 64bit_mode_dma_mask field to strct mmc_host, initialize
   that to 64-bit by default and let host drivers override it

While the first one creates a little more boilerplate code it actually
looks cleaner to me.  The added benefit is that it can also replace the
usage of SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA.
