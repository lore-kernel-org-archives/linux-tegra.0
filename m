That's a lot of things for one patch. Can this please be split up?

In particular, I would like a separate patch for the final bullet point,
and for that patch to be the first in the series, so that we can merge
it into both the Tegra and cpufreq trees if needed to resolve any conflicts.

Why make this a hidden option? It'd be best to leave it user-visible, so
that existing defconfigs aren't broken by this change.

I think that Exynos change is a mistake?

Shouldn't that be ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC specifically?

Does the syntax "default ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ" work? Actually, this should
depend on ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ rather than select it, and that way you can
keep this "default y" and it'll only be enabled if Tegra cpufreq is enabled.

In summary, I think the following should work well:

config ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ
	bool "TEGRA CPUFreq support"
	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	select CPU_FREQ_TABLE

config ARM_TEGRA20_CPUFREQ
	bool "NVIDIA TEGRA20"
	depends on ARM_TEGRA_CPUFREQ && ARCH_TEGRA_2x_SOC
	default y
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for NVIDIA TEGRA20 SoC.

	  If in doubt, say N.

NUM_ or MAX_?

There's a mix of runtime and configuration-time data there. It'd be
nicer to split the two out, so that all the configuration data could be
in a const struct that's pointed to by a field in the runtime data
struct, or passed back out of tegra20_cpufreq_init() as a separate
pointer variable and assigned to a separate global in tegra-cpufreq.c,
to avoid double-indirections everywhere at runtime.

Should/can we query that list from the clock driver?

With the struct split I proposed above, most of that could just be:

*soc_config = &tegra20_cpufreq_config;

where there's an extra function parameter "struct tegra_cpufreq_config
**soc_config", and most of those values are in a static const
tegra_cpufreq_config tegra20_cpufreq_config = { ... }.
