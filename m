Yes.

Why do you care which USB controller is driving the pins?

I realised that wasn't what you were doing, but at first it did seem
to be what you were doing.

Some of those look like pcb design decisions - so there is no dynamic
changing, just config time plumbing.
OTOH we are carrying PCIe using two SATA cables (the second carries the
clock) so I suspect some SoC system pcbs may be able to support SATA
or PCIe on the same connector).
