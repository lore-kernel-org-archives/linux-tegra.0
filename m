I think higher precision is not related directly to maximum frequency. 
Precision will much depends on the perfect multiples between period and 
clock source frequency.

If some usecases needed the perfect periods then the clock source 
frequency can be set via clock init table for clock driver to achieve 
the perfect PWM period. on this case, we should not change it in the PWM 
driver.
PWM driver should only worry about to limit the maximum.

Getting information for the older SoCs are little bit difficult. Let me 
try if possible from HW team.

Otherwise, What we can do now as we can make 38.4MHz till T210 and 102M 
for T186.
