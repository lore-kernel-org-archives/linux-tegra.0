Possible. Will re-send anyway with your feedback fixes.

> Why are these being done as nVidia specific properties rather than generi=
c ones and why are these being configured in DT rather than by the client d=
river?  If the devices have particular timing requirements for chip select =
presumably that's going to apply no matter what controller or system they'r=
e used with so it seems best to configure this in the client driver and hav=
e an API that any controller can implement.

These are implemented thru DT as Tegra SPI is master and master controls th=
e timing.
Some SPI slaves have specific requirements of certain CS setup/hold time an=
d inactive cycles which SPI master should meet when driving during transfer=
 and Tegra SPI controller supports tuning these parameters.
