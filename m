Yes, moving the documentation to a generic location would be appropriat=

in my opinion.

I don't believe compatible values should be interpreted according to=20
context; compatible value matching isn't implemented that way AFAIK, an=
d=20
I'm not aware of any precedent for it to work that way.

Did the discussion involve the core DT maintainers? If so, whatever the=
y=20
decided can stick. Otherwise, the discussion should be rubn by them.
