Whether there are more than one conflict, I don't know. I just stopped
at patch 23.

Moreover, there are other patches for sdhci that have been posted and
being discussed. In principle, we then need to put all these on hold
to prevent further conflicts. I guess that doable, as long as we don't
to that for too long. Maybe Chris have some more thoughts how to
handle this!?

Kind regards
