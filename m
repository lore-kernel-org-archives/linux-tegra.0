Will,

I just remembered one other advantage of disable_nonboot_cpus(); it
always makes the kexec happen on the boot CPU. Without this, I believe
it's random whether CPU0 or CPU1 performs the kexec. I suspect it's most
likely to work if we can always kexec on the boot CPU rather than a
random CPU?

Joseph, Peter,

As you know, I've been looking into kexec[2] on Tegra. Here's a summary
of a few tests I did:

linux-next plus nothing in particular, SMP enabled:
* Hangs/crashes during kexec

linux-next + SMP disabled: kexec works

linux-next + hotunplug CPUs other than CPU0 before kexec: kexec works

Will Deacon suggested this was due to a missing implementation of struct
smp_operations .cpu_kill on Tegra, which means that when CPUn are
present, they're simply spinning executing code, and kexec will
eventually overwrite that code, causing all manner of problems. So,
since I noticed that Joseph posted an implementation of .cpu_kill for
Tegra, I tried that out[1]. It certainly doesn't solve the problem, and
in fact actually causes the kernel performing the kexec (rather than the
kexec'd kernel) to hang:

Manually hotunplugging the CPUs first still works OK with those patches
applied though.

I /think/ kexec calls .cpu_kill() without having caused the CPU itself
to call .cpu_die() first? Did you allow for that possibility inside the
implementation you posted?
