Ok, I can assume that, when parsing generic IOMMU binding, SoC specific
callback could be called from ARM,SMMU driver to assign allocated
"StreamIDs" to thier "RequesterIDs".

IOW, IOMMU generic binding for ARM,SMMU can have RequresterID instead of
StreamID.

  Not:
  	iommus = <&{/arm-smmu} "StreamID">;
  
  Instead, can be:
  	iommus = <&{/arm-smmu} "RequresterID">;

If I extend the above, even ARM,SMMU driver could have any number of
params, which SoC requires with keeping "arm,mmu-*" compatibility?

  	iommus = <&{/arm-msmmu} param1 param2 param3 param4 .....>;

How to parse params depends on SoC. Parsing params is done at SoC
callback, right?

Any pointer would be really appreciated.
