TBH I rather feel like the time for converting ARM to iommu-dma has 
passed - there are drivers which rely on specific behaviours of the ARM 
IOVA allocator which iommu-dma does not match, and meanwhile iommu-dma 
continues to grow more server-specific features which would be nothing 
but bloat on ARMv7 systems with <=2GB of RAM and no virtualisation. At 
this point I'm inclined to treat the existing DMA ops as legacy code 
like with alpha/sparc/etc.

While there is technically an option 4, to have tegra-smmu do what 
ipmmu-vmsa and mtk_iommu_v1 do and go coercing the ARM dma_iommu_mapping 
into groups behind the arch code's back, I am also still hoping to get 
rid of that and the messy probe_finalize step altogether. FWIW my 
preference would be some form of option 2 - off-hand I imagine you could 
probably get most of the way there by propagating the ARM mapping 
through group->iommudata (ironically tegra-smmu being the only driver in 
the way of that - looks like it could probably do its internal group 
accounting explicitly in release_device instead), plus one or two 
special cases to recognise ARM DMA domains in the core code as you say. 
The more involved, but ultimately neater, option would be to turn the 
ARM mapping inside-out and make it a proper domain cookie type with the 
ARM code providing its own definitions of iommu_{get,put}_dma_cookie() 
and iommu_setup_dma_ops(), so it could then work as a proper 
IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA default domain, and we can lose the current 
ARM-specific identity domain bodges as well. I reckon the impact of that 
to core code shouldn't be much worse than the existing special-cases it 
would replace, while on the arch side it should effectively only really 
redistribute the current arm_setup_iommu_dma_ops() path, so functionally 
pretty low risk as well. It's just liable to be fiddly to do in 
manageable steps rather than one giant patch changing everything at once...

Cheers,
Robin.
