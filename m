Okay, seems I see now what you're meaning. The PLLX is specifically
dedicated to CPU HW on Tegra, so it shouldn't be questioning to put it
within the CPU node, unlike the backup.

The assigned-clocks are about static clocks configuration, that is
exactly opposite to what is needed. I'm not sure what you are trying to
convey.. we don't need to get the parent clock, but set it.

How the backup/intermediate clock should be represented then? It is a
part of HW description which potentially may vary depending on the board
configuration.
