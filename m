Setting cmd_timeout_ms to zero just makes the sdhci driver choose the
highest timeout.

Currently the sdhci driver does not have a facility to disable the timeout,
and, as I noted in another thread, masking the "Data Timeout Error Status
Enable" and "Data Timeout Error Signal Enable" bits did not work for me.
What Ulf is suggesting is to change the response type from R1B to R1.

But there is also a need to avoid polling when it is not necessary and to
make it periodic.

Ulf said he is working on a patch to doing something similar with mmc_switch.
