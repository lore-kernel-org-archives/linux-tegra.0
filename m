Yes, I have been thinking about that as well. I will have a look at that.

There is a lock protecting accesses to the PMC registers which
ultimately control the power domain. However, may be it would be better
to ensure that any power-domain registered with genpd cannot be
controlled by the legacy APIs. I have added a bitmap to mark valid
power-domains to ensure that only valid power domains can be controlled
by these legacy APIs. I could mark the power-domain invalid after
registering with genpd to ensure that it cannot be accessed by the
legacy APIs.

Right and some of the legacy APIs are entrenched in some drivers. So to
keep the patch set manageable it seems best to get some support in place
then start migrating the drivers.

Yes, that would be ideal. However, would have require changing
genpd_init()? I am not sure how genpd would be able to access the device
struct for the powergate driver because we don't provide this via any
API I am aware of? And I am guessing that you don't wish to expose the
gpd_list to the world either.

If there is an easy way, I am open to it, but looking at it today, I am
not sure I see a simple way in which we could add a new API to do this.
However, may be I am missing something!

Jon
