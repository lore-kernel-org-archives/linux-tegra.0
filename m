You added that to a list of properties that are required for the SMMU
node. However, judging by the example below, this property should be
added to the SMMU client nodes. Please keep the two lists separate, for
example:

Required properties for SMMU node:
...

Required properties for SMMU client nodes:
...

Why one cell for the host1x property, and two cells for the gr3d
property; shouldn't they be the same length?

Bikeshedding a bit, but "nvidia,smmu" seems like it'd be a better
property name, since the property is really about defining which other
node is the SMMU that affects the device, and the SWGROUP IDs are just
part of the SMMU specifier that goes along with the phandle.

of_parse_phandle_with_fixed_args() might be a good fit here, or perhaps
require a property #smmu-cells in the SMMU node, thus allowing the
non-fixed-length of_parse_phandle_with_args() to be used here.

Don't you need to shift swgroup too? I thought the two cells in DT were
LSB and MSB, yet here you're ORing both cells into the LSBs.
