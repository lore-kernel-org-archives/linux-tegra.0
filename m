That seems like a good way of making it more robust!

Thanks for elaborating on this! I get and like the idea of moving forward!

If we add a new __pm_genpd_init() API, that could require a struct
device to be provided. That API will thus invoke the existing
pm_genpd_init() but also deal with the extra things needed here.

I would also allow such an API to return an error code.

Correspondingly, pm_genpd_remove() could be required to be provided
with a struct device.

Existing users of pm_genpd_init() can then convert to
__pm_genpd_init() whenever suitable.

Of course, another option is just to add new member in the genpd
struct for the struct *device. The caller of pm_genpd_init() could
check it, but allow it to be NULL. Although, the pm_genpd_remove() API
would require that pointer to the struct device to be set...

What do you think?

Kind regards
Uffe
