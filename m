I guess this patch on it's own seems reasonable, so we should maybe
apply it as a short term solution!?

To solve the real problem, I think we shall not consider the
"max_discard_to" while calculating the max_discard value. Instead I
think we shall be able to make an estimation of a fixed number of
erase blocks (maybe considering the size of the card of something).

Then we instead calculates what busy detection timeout, this fixed
number of erase blocks, gives us.

For hosts not supporting MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY, the calculated busy
detection timeout will be of less importance, since I think we should
rely on polling with CMD13 to find out when the erase operation is
completed.

For hosts supporting MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY, the calculated busy
detection timeout can turn out to be bigger than what the host
supports. In this case we need to decide whether we still should
expect the host to handle busy detection but with an indefinite
timeout, or if should prevent the host from using busy detection and
do polling with CMD13 instead.

Does this make sense?

Kind regards
