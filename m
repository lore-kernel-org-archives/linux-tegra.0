Yeah, you just hit a corner case. Sorry about that :(

Can you try a patch that I sent to you instead? Its subject is:

[PATCH] PM / OPP: 'UNKNOWN' status of opp-table->shared

Also I would like to know one more thing. You can hit this bug only if
some other piece of code for your platform is creating OPP table for
the CPUs. Which code is doing that ?
