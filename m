Yes, unfortunately it has sailed as we cannot break compatibility AFAIK.
However, that said, I am not 100% certain for cases where there is a bug
like this.

I did double check this morning and verified that the gpio is low when
the charger is connected and so it is inverted.

I guess that ideally the polarity should have been specified correctly
by the gpio property, but even this looks wrong for Tegra as it is
GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH and not LOW. The only other option is to add another
property called something like 'ti,ac-detect-override-pol' to specify
the polarity you want.

To be honest, I am not sure how this type of thing is normally handled.
So probably best to put together a patch with whatever option you feel
best and explain why this is needed and see what the dev-tree folks say.

Cheers
Jon
