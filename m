That is a very good point.  Addressing it led me to a revised scheme 
that I like much better.  (Notice that in the notes below I address your 
reasonable desire for an immutable SoC core definition.)

The example:

     gpio-controller1: gpio-controller {
         #address-cells = <2>;
         #mode-cells = <2>;
         unbound_gpio1: gpio {
             /* No reg property */
             /* No mode property */
         }
         fully_bound_gpio1: audio-chipsel@12,0 {
             reg = <12 0>;
             mode = <55 66>;
             usage = "Audio Codec chip select";  /* Optional */
         }
         address_bound_gpio1: gpio@13,0 {
             reg = <13 0>;
             /* No mode property */
         }
         mode_bound_gpio1: open-drain-gpio {
             /* No reg property */
             mode = <77 88>;
         }
     };
     gpio-controller2: gpio-controller {
          #address-cells = <1>;
          #mode-cells = <1>;
          unbound_gpio2: gpio {
              /* No reg property */
              /* No mode property */
          }
          address_bound_gpio2: gpio@4 {
              reg = <4>;
              /* No mode property */
          }
     };
     [...]
     chipsel-gpio =
         <&fully_bound_gpio1>,
         <&unbound_gpio1 13 0 55 77>,
         <&mode_bound_gpio1 14 0>,
         <&address_bound_gpio2 88>,
         <&unbound_gpio2 5 1>;

Notes:

a) A reference to a GPIO always points to the child of a 
gpio-controller, i.e. to an individual gpio node.

b) If that gpio node has a "reg" property, the number of address cells 
in the reference is 0, otherwise it is #address-cells from the parent 
(gpio-controller) node.

c) If that gpio node has a "mode" property, the number of mode cells in 
the reference is 0, otherwise it is #mode-cells from the parent 
(gpio-controller) node.

d) It's unnecessary for all children of a gpio controller to be named 
just "gpio".  The important thing is that the semantics of the node - 
the set of properties (and, for Open Firmware systems, the set of 
methods) - meet the usage needs of the node's "client".

e) gpios that are mode-bound but not address-bound must have distinct
names from each other and from the unbound node name ("gpio"), because 
of the device tree rule that the combination of name+address must be 
unique among the children of a given node.  It is okay to have both 
"gpio" and "gpio@12", but you cannot have two nodes both named just "gpio".

f) SoC device tree blobs would probably use only the unbound form.  A 
given platform might choose to specialize the tree by adding additional 
bound nodes to the tree established by the unmodified SoC core blob.

g) reg-less nodes have been part of the Open Firmware spec forever; they 
are called "wildcard nodes".  Their intended use is to refer to a class 
of similar objects, potentially so numerous that full enumeration is 
undesireable.
