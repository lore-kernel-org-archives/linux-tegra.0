If those fields remain set to 0, then there will be no DEBUG_LL output.

However, assuming use of a compressed zImage rather than an
uncompressed Image then at this stage in the series, uncompress.h
writes the UART selection and a cookie to Tegra's IRAM, and
debug-macro.S reads that selection, and re-initializes those fields to
whatever uncompress.h chose.

In patch 2 in the series, the coupling between uncompress.h and
debug-macro.S is entirely removed, and instead, debug-macro.S
initializes those values the first time a character is printed.

The values aren't hard-coded there since they are now (after patch 2)
always over-written. Even when a single static UART is selected, we
can't hard-code the address since debug-macro.S validates that the
clock and reset bits to the UART are correctly set before using it,
hence we might end up not using the UART anyway.
