When doing this kind of work with sed -i, that doesn't happen.  There's
too much of this crap (and I've been telling people about this for at
least a year) that I don't think there's that luxury anymore.

If maintainers would have paid more attention, then most of these changes
would not be necessary.  My view is that if maintainers do care about this
stuff _they_ should have been the ones to pick up on it long ago.  In
other words, they've lost the right to complain about petty crap like
the ordering of includes through their own inaction on this point.
