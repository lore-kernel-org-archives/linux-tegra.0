I would like to ack this but I think this is one of those differences
for which there is a reason.

On x86 this happens in machine_shutdown.

Before this can be merged someone needs to look into the history and
see why we don't share this code path.

My hunch is because it was duplication of effort and the stop machine
code has historically been fragile.
