MSIs are indistinguishable from other memory-write transactions originating
from the RC other than the address they target. Anything that can capture
that write in the address space (even a page fault) could be an MSI controller
and call interrupt handlers. And so the RC / MSI controllers don't need to
be aware of each other.
