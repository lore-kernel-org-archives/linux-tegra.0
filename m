OK, I applied that, and USB appears to work; I could mount the SSD OK.

I found a way to get around aplay/speaker-test crashing (which happens
both with the ChromeOS filesystem or the Ubuntu filesystem shipped with
the Trimslice). If you specify which ALSA PCM device to use ("-D hw:0,0")
then they both work OK.

That said, I do still see some issues. Specifically, when I play audio,
USB and/or MMC IO appear to go south, and then recovers when audio
playback terminates:

chronos@localhost ~ $ aplay -D hw:0,0 /home/abba-dq-48000-stereo.wav

Sometimes this affects mmcblk0 too.

This happens irrespective of whether my root filesystem is on USB (with
no SD card plugged in) or on SD card.

That said, I think these issues are some pre-existing condition that was
simply exposed because this patchset now enables USB and audio. Hence,
not a problem with the changes in the patch set itself.

Do you have a kernel branch that's been tested with the Ubuntu build
that shipped on the TrimSlice's SSD that I could test with? Alternatively,
how did you create the filesystem you're testing with, so I could test
with that instead?

Thanks.
