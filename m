I don't understand what that means.

I'm not sure what that means. Perhaps you're sauying the dev->driver
isn't set until the driver is probe()d for the device, so if
dev->driver!=NULL, then we know the driver probed() successfully for it?
That does go most of the way, but as Thierry pointed out, it doesn't
guarantee that the dev->driver is an IOMMU driver, just that it's *some*
driver. Perhaps this won't actually make any difference in practice, but
AFAIK, all other subsystems do perform the strict check, so I don't see
why the IOMMU subsystem shouldn't.

Yes, smmu_b is related to a bus.

Admittedly perhaps not a bus that the CPU can master transactions onto,
but there's still a (perhaps point-point) bus that device_a masters, and
smmu_b acts as a slave.

Note that not all buses in the diagram above are represented as bus
objects in the Linux kernel (or even in DT), since those tend to
concentrate only on representing buses that the CPU masters, rather than
additionally representing buses that only HW devices master.
