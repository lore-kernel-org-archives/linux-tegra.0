Well, it's even worse to have a bunch of other drivers randomly trample
on a set of registers they don't own.

There are already global variables exposed by the Tegra fuse driver; can
you just read those?

The pad control registers are part of the pinmux HW, so it makes perfect
sense for the pinmux driver to control them. The APB misc registers
aren't part of the clock register set, so it doesn't make sense to the
clock driver to touch them.
