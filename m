By this you mean something like what Thierry suggested here?

I understood above that you propose probing devices in order, but now
you mention that resource getters would block until the dependency is
fulfilled which confuses me because if we are probing in order then
all dependencies would be fulfilled before the device in question gets
probed.

Yeah, I was planning looking into this now that I got it working with
async probing.
