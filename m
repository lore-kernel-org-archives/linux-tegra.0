The fix is in linux-next, and will be in mainline soon I expect.

My github linux-tegra.git isn't relevant since it's just my own personal 
dev branch, but for reference, the commit is there since it's based on 
linux-next.

Your patch should probably be CC: stable so that existing kernel 
versions get fixed. That said, I'd argue that since the original patch 
never actually had any effect since it applied to the wrong node, the 
best fix for stable kernels is simply to revert it rather than fixing 
it, to avoid the potential for behaviour changes and regressions. 
Starting with kernel 4.8 (I think), that patch will begin to have actual 
effect.
