Well, I considred that memory-client's' ~= 'a' swgroup, and the term
"swgroup" isn't used in HOTREST, where actually each bit represents
a "swgroup".

In our downstream, basically I provided to two conversion tables, one
for "MC_SMMU_<swgroup ID>_ASID_0" and the other for "HOTRESET"
bit. That table converts ID to them respectively. I think that this is
acceptable.
