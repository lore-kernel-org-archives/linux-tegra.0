I think this is what's happening:

The Tegra SMMU driver is registered using subsys_initcall().

The Tegra AHB driver is registered using module_platform_driver, so
module_init().

The device objects for both are registered at basically the same time
during the machine's initialization call, which I think happens before
both or some of the above two calls.

So, SMMU ends up getting probed before the AHB driver has even been
registered.

That's why in patch Hiroshi linked, in tegra_ahb_enable_smmu(), the AHB
driver hasn't (or may not have) been registered, so driver_find_device()
can experience the issue this patch attempts to solve.
