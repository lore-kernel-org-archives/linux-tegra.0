There are a fixed number of allowed EMC OPPs per board. For each OPP there is
a set of EMC parameters, the parent clock and the rate for the parent clock
defined. Due to jitter requirements these settings have to be used. It's
not allowed to choose a different parent even when that would result in the
same clock rate.

Due to the interlock between the CAR block and the EMC controller, there
is a precise sequence of register accesses to be followed when doing a EMC
frequency switch. Changing the EMC clock parent or divider in CAR triggers
a state machine in the EMC controller which causes a bunch of shadow registers
to take effect and a FIFO of commands to be send to the SDRAM chips.
Because of this precise sequence, I think a single entity should be responsible
for handling this. Splitting the sequence in multiple parts maintained by
different people, will greatly increase the risk of difficult to trace
stability regressions.
