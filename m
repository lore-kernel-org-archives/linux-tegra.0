Ok, fine with me.

Yes, I have purposely not tried to handle suspend here as I have left it
to be handle by suspend_device_irqs() called during system suspend.

I don't follow why we need to handle regular suspend here? Or is this
for chips that do not support runtime-pm?

So today with this patch, the IRQ chip would only be runtime suspended
if all IRQs are freed. So it should not impact wakeups. Unless I am
missing something?

Yes, I agree, additional checking such as the above would be helpful.
Thanks.
