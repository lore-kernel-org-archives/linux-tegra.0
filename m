This is now supposed to be handled by the timer core stuff.  It
looks to me like 3d06770eef43eaad606e77246bfcc7e82b1d9fb4
(arm: Add generic timer broadcast support) is slightly busted in
that it doesn't deal with the #else case you identified below.

Certainly, initializing evt->broadcast after the setup is not the
right solution - it must be done before, but this was removed by
the above commit.

So, things to be done here:
1. Fix the #else part of the code.
2. Fix the reported oops.

I think this falls to Mark, being the last one to touch this and cause
this breakage. :)
