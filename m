I vaguely recall people speaking out against including "spidev" devices
in DT because they don't represent actual HW, but rather a way to
request that the SPI bus be exposed to user-space, which is a pure SW
issue. Wouldn't it be better if the spidev interface worked like
I2C_CHARDEV, where fake devices weren't actually required?
