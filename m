I think we need some representation of that AXI switch in the DT;
whether simple-pm-bus is appropriate is another question. We probably
need a specific compatible string / binding regardless.

Thanks,

Ok; if we model the apb_pclk as owned by the AXI switch (which it is),
then there's no change for the GIC binding, short of the additional
compatible string as an extension of "arm,gic-400", as we already model
that clock in the GIC-400 binding.

Thanks,
Mark.
