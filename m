I agree with Stephen that this is a clever way to encode all the address spaces,
very nice!

This is similar to how the PCI binding works internally, but I find that
a bit confusing as well, so given those two choices, I'd prefer the first
one.

My guess is that it doesn't work with the current Linux code that transforms
the addresses. I've just recently seen the code complain about any platform
device whose parent has #size-cells=0.
