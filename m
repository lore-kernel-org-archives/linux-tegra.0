Yes, currently if there are any errors we can't determine which clock's
vote is causing the error since the rate only takes effect when the
clock is enabled and another clock could have updated their rate while
the list is being iterated over.

The code could be written so that we only call clk_set_rate() on the
parent when the calling clock affects the aggregate rate. That would
allow us to catch errors for the clk_enable() path and the
clk_set_rate() path when the clock is already on. In the clk_disable()
path we could just ignore the errors since we can't do anything anyways
like you say. The only path that doesn't seem possible is clk_set_rate()
when the clock is off which presumably doesn't actually matter since
when you turn the clock on it will fail the same way (delayed
clk_set_rate?).

BTW, is there a race there in the rate updating code? Say clock 1 is
enabled with rate 2 on cpu1 and clock 2 is enabled at the same time with
rate 3 (currently the greatest rate) on cpu2. clock 1 is iterating over
the list and sees that clock 2 is enabled so it calculates 3 as the max.
clock 2 then returns from the enable call and then a call to disable
clock 2 comes in. clock 1 is still iterating over the list and clock 2's
call to disable runs to completion. clock 1 finally stops iterating over
the list and has an aggregated rate of 3 (since it saw that clock 2 was
on which is no longer true). It then calls set_rate() with 3 even though
the only clock that is on is clock 1 with a rate of 2.

c1 and c2 are off initially

CPU1                    CPU2
----                    -----
clk_set_rate(c1, 2)     clk_set_rate(c2, 3)
clk_enable(c1)          clk_enable(c2)
max == 3                max == 3; clk_set_rate(parent, 3)
...                     clk_disable(c2)
                        max == 2; clk_set_rate(parent, 2)
clk_set_rate(parent, 3)

I think you need some kind of lock while iterating to stop the shared
clocks from changing underneath you.

I would hope clk_round_rate() isn't necessary to get a valid rate.
clk_set_rate() shouldn't require exact/valid rates. clk_round_rate() is
there to help drivers determine if calling clk_set_rate() with a certain
rate is going to give them something they want. It's like saying "If I
call clk_set_rate() with 500Hz what would the clock's rate actually be
after the call returns?" If the set_rate implementation needs to round
internally to find a divider or something, it should be done in the
set_rate code and not in each driver.

Oops, thanks. Time to visit the optometrist.
