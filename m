Right, currently I'm modeling the Type-C controller as an extcon
device and handle the role-changes in the core drivers, but that
doesn't really make sense for the non-Type-C case where we use the
XUSB padctl controller and need a full OTG state-machine.  Roger's new
OTG/DRD framework would fit my situation perfectly since it makes the
host/device-controller drivers independent from all the
OTG/role-changing logic.  The only issue is the requirement that the
OTG/DRD controller be the parent device of the host/device
controllers.

Thanks,
Andrew
