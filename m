Looks the compiler can take care of this. I didn't see any problem here.

That's more easy to read the code indeed. Will do.

Will double confirm again later.

Only true for Tegra30 now. Will fix.

Yes, I will add the code when I add LP2 support for Tegra114 later.
Currently the LP2 code flow only for Tegra30, so it's OK.

I personally think the conditional code is OK. And the ARM CPU also had
hardware for branch detection also.

I had finished some further features for both Tegra30 and Tegra114. And
most of the code here can be shared each other at least until now I
could see. Once I see if there is a significant difference, then I would
prepare maintain the code separately too.
