There are still two main features for PMC that we need to define
bindings/properties in DT. One is power main the other wake up source.
But we are not there yet. Because I don't have drivers to verify them is
enough or not. If I add all the bindings right now, I believe it will be
modify later.

Yes.

Yes, it's only for new features.
