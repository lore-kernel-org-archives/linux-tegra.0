of_pm_clk_add_clks() would typically be called from the .attach_dev()
callback of the PM Domain, for all devices in the PM Domain. However, there may
exist devices without clocks properties, or without gateable clocks.

Yes, that what I meant:
  (current) -ENODEV => (new) 0
  (current) 0 => (new) number of clocks added

Sorry for the confusion.

Perhaps. I'll think about it...

That's fine for me.

Note that if the need arises for the filter function, you'll have to add a new
function and make the old one a wrapper, to avoid having to update all
existing users that don't use the filter function.
