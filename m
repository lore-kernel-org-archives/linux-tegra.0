Glad you like it better than my previous attempts at controlling Tegra's 
panels and backlights. ;)

Since EDID information is per-panel I'd intuitively say it should be 
provided by the panel driver.

As of now, yes.

I have just written a bit of code that does that. It works well and 
seems like a natural way to operate the backlight. However...

... that's where thing stop looking nice. The backlight framework 
forcibly registers a framebuffer notifier callback and switches the 
backlight on and off on blank/unblank events, effectively duplicating 
what the panel driver does. There is no way to disable this behavior at 
the moment.

This could be solved by introducing a new function for controlling the 
"ownership" of the backlight that would unregister the notifier when the 
panel driver takes its reference to the backlight.

For cosmetic reasons I'd prefer to avoid having two backlight devices 
(which ended up in that terrible PWM backlight subdriver thing). Maybe 
we can engineer the backlight framework to make such customizations easier?

Alex.
