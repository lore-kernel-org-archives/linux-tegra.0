I suppose there's little point changing it back; I know others objected
to the original code:-(

The only issue I see that could happen is that
tegra20_cpu_set_resettable_soon() writes to some location to maintain
the CPU resettable state. Since I assume that location isn't used for
that purpose on Tegra30, could this cause some conflict? It seems best
to add the check to make sure there's no issue here.
