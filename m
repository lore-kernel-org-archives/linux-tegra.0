Besides that instrumenting every call to another driver in order to fix
a onetime operation (the initialization) sounds like an enormous
overhead. Initialization is done pnly once, regardless how long a system
runs, but the instrumentation to fix this onetime operation would slow
down the operation during the whole runtime of a system.

I don't think this is what should be done.
