There have been no changes in bindings since v4 (other than squashing
consumer and provider bindings into a single patch and fixing typos).

The last DT comment was on v9 [1] where Rob wanted confirmation from
other SoC vendors that this works for them too. And now we have that
confirmation and there are patches posted on the list [2].

The second thing (also discussed at LPC) was about possible cases where
some consumer drivers can't calculate how much bandwidth they actually
need and how to address that. The proposal was to extend the OPP
bindings with one more property, but this is not part of this patchset.
It is a future step that needs more discussion on the mailing list. If a
driver really needs some bandwidth data now, it should be put into the
driver and not in DT. After we have enough consumers, we can discuss
again if it makes sense to extract something into DT or not.

Thanks,
Georgi
