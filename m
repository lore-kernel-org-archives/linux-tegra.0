I think that after the review, the Tegra patches that are considered for
upstream they should go to -next via the PCI tree as any other platform PCI
patches; the relevant patches need ACKs from the respective platform
maintainer - I am getting to them as fast as I can.

Yes timing is not ideal - I won't be able to review anything in the -rc5
week either but apart from that I should be online.
