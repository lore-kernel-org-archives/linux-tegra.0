Will fix.

I guess I can just remove the BUG()s and keep going. The clock might 
temporarily end up in a strange state but that should be fine since 
these shouldn't be happening anyway.

The core doesn't allow writing to the rate debugfs files, so this is the 
only way to trigger an EMC clock change for now. I agree that the core 
might be a better place. I don't know if there are any philosophical 
objections to that. I'd like to keep this in until a possible core 
feature addition. Mike, any comments?

True. I'll fix this.

My local v2 already has the MC-related code split into Thierry's MC 
driver. The CAR register writing is still done from the EMC driver. I 
could add helpers for it to the CAR driver.

Thanks,
