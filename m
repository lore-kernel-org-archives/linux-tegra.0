Well, sorry, but who was asking whom, specifically?

The underlying problem is present in ACPI too and we don't really have =
a good
solution for it.  We might benefit from a common one if it existed.

But also about making the driver core slighly OF-centric.

Sure, we need OF-specific code and ACPI-specific code wherever differen=
t
handling is required, but doing that at the driver core level seems to =
be
a bit of a stretch to me.

Please note that we don't really have ACPI-specific calls in the driver=
 core,
although we might have added them long ago even before the OF stuff app=
eared
in the kernel for the first time.  We didn't do that, (among other thin=
gs)
because we didn't want that particular firmware interface to appear spe=
cial
in any way and I'm not really sure why it is now OK to make OF look spe=
cial
instead.

If it is trivial to avoid that (and you seem to be arguing that it is),=
 why
do we have to do it?

Thanks,
Rafael
