I think the objection to these patches is that they special case the
instantiation of some devices. It's not a proper solution because it
implies various things. For example merely instantiating the IOMMU
device earlier than others is only going to work *if* the driver is
actually probed before the drivers of other devices. If you want to
build the driver as a module for example, probe order becomes entirely
non-deterministic.

So what Grant was saying is that you could possibly make it work by
forcing the driver to be loaded earlier using explicit initcall
ordering. But he also said that's not recommended because it's not a
proper solution and therefore not guaranteed to always work.

Explicit initcall ordering used to be heavily used in the past, but
there have been many efforts to move away from it. One of the solutions
introduced to help with that is deferred probing, which essentially adds
a new error code (EPROBE_DEFER) which a driver's .probe() can return to
cause it to be probed at a later point again, after other drivers have
been probed.

How this works is basically that a driver's .probe() requests whatever
resources it needs (GPIOs, clocks, regulators, ...). If any of those
resources isn't there yet (presumably because the driver providing it
hasn't been probed yet), it can return -EPROBE_DEFER to signal that not
all of its dependencies are available yet.

Instead of handling such dependencies implicitly by making sure all
resource providers are probed earlier than any of their consumers, the
dependencies are handled more explicitly, which turns out to simplify
things a lot. There's some additional work required in the core, but if
done consistently no driver needs to care about the dependencies and it
no longer matters where the resources come from. The problem is reduced
to essentially this:

	while (!resource_available())
		load_more_drivers();

So my proposed solution for the IOMMU case is to treat it the same as
any other resources. Perhaps resource isn't the right word, but at the
core the issue is the same. A device requires the services of an IOMMU
so that it can be put into the correct address space. If the IOMMU is
not available yet it cannot do that, so we simply return -EPROBE_DEFER
and cause the probe to be retried later.

Eventually the IOMMU driver will be probed and register the IOMMU. When
the earlier driver is probed again, it will be able to successfully
request to be put into the proper address space and continue with the
initialization.

Does that answer your question?
