I was talking about the lack of a place to store context for the IOMMU
itself. Currently none of the functions in iommu_ops have a way to get
access to the IOMMU context itself. In fact there's not even a common
structure that could be used for this purpose. I have a couple of local
patches that try to add something like that, along with functions to
more explicitly hook up a device with it's IOMMU(s). It looks somewhat
like this:

	struct iommu {
		struct device *dev;

		struct list_head list;

		const struct iommu_ops *ops;
	};

	/* register and unregister IOMMU device with core */
	int iommu_add(struct iommu *iommu);
	void iommu_remove(struct iommu *iommu);

	/*
	 * Attach a device to one or more IOMMUs (according to the
	 * iommus property).
	 */
	int iommu_attach(struct device *dev);
	int iommu_detach(struct device *dev);

Does that look like a direction that we would want to pursue?

Perhaps you mean this:

	[PATCHv3 1/3] device.h: arm dma-iommu: Move out dma_iommu_mapping struct

? From a quick glance that indeed looks like a promising step towards
unifying this across architectures.

Right, I think up to that point things should be fine with the existing
IOMMU API and using only DMA mapping functions.

I'm specifically thinking about cases where we want to use the IOMMU to
isolate processes from each other. This is probably most relevant for
GPUs, since they are driven to a large degree from userspace. Other
peripherals are mostly services in kernel space exclusively, so I don't
think the issue is as relevant there.

On Tegra there's two IOMMUs, one system-wide and another one directly
used by the GPU (and programmed by the GPU driver (nouveau)). For the
latter it probably doesn't make sense to expose it via the IOMMU API,
and we may be able to get sufficient process isolation using only it
rather than in combination with the SMMU. However some of the graphics
components don't master through the GPU's IOMMU, so if we want any kind
of process isolation there we may need to control the IOMMU more
explicitly. I'm still trying to get a more full understanding of this,
but it would seem to me that we'd need some way to use different domains
(which I think is the proper abstraction for what the Tegra SMMU calls
an Address Space ID (ASID)) in one driver, depending on the current
process.
