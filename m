Right, it's true that this kernel error showed up in the previous
bisection I ran last week.  As this time it found another commit
I thought it might be worthwhile sharing the result.

Thanks for the update.  Please keep in mind that DRM_MOUVEAU was
disabled in every iteration this time, so there might also be
something else unrelated to DRM.

Agreed, it's not worth bisecting much further.  In fact I found
these issues mostly as a side effect of working on the automatic
bisection mechanism in kernelci.org, and linux-next is especially
tricky to bisect.  On this subject, we'll probably start by
enabling this on stable trees and mainline, then see what we can
do with linux-next and other tricky trees at a later stage.

Thanks,
Guillaume
