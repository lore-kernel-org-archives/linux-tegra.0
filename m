    The generic PHY framework (drivers/phy/phy-core.c) supports multifunction 
"complex" PHYs (some functions of which may be related to USB). My case is a 
Renesas R-Car generation 2 PHY that can switch two USB ports between different 
USB controllers (one PCI and one non-PCI on each port); I just haven't CCed 
linux-usb on my driver submission. Though there's already drivers/phy/usb/ 
driver for that hardware, it failed to meet the expectations (dynamic setting 
of the port multiplexing depending on what USB host/gadget drivers are 
loaded), so I had to write a new driver. I guess I don't need to describe 
drivers/phy/usb/ framework in detail, do I? It only provides for 
single-function "simple" USB PHYs...
