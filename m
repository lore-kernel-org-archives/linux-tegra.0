With recent linux-next I've got a similar issue on Samsung Exynos based
Chromebooks: Peach-Pit and Peach-Pi, both using SPI for communicating
with regulators via chrome EC bridge:

PM: suspend entry (deep)
PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.
OOM killer disabled.
Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.001 seconds) done.
printk: Suspending console(s) (use no_console_suspend to debug)
...
spi_master spi2: could not stop message queue
spi_master spi2: queue stop failed
dpm_run_callback(): platform_pm_suspend+0x0/0x54 returns -16
PM: Device 12d40000.spi failed to suspend: error -16
PM: Some devices failed to suspend, or early wake event detected
