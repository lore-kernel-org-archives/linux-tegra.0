I believe powerpc has a boot-time option to enforce the immediate
IOTLB flush, which is very useful for device driver debugging when
something goes wrong with stale DMAs.

I don't know what a Pdir is, but I guess strictly speaking we have
to ensure that all IO page table entries that have been unmapped by
a driver are marked as invalid at least by the time the IOTLB is flushed,
plus we have to flush each entry before it gets reused for a different
page.
