I just checked the schematic and it is indeed the ACOK.

Yes I see the same in the TI datasheet.

Hmmm ... looking closer at the schematics I see a power-MOSFET in the
path of the ACOK to the Tegra and it looks like this could be inverting
the signal! Seems this was not caught when the code was submitted. This
should have been described in the device-tree somewhere :-(
