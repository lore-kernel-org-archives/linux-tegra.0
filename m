If messages end up being given from the subsystem rather than the driver,
surely they become more consistent?

The patch is not complete (read the description above).

That's a possibility.

The idea is not to report anything for drivers that were deferred
during the normal bootup.  The above is part of the normal bootup,
and the deferred activity should not be warned about.

If we have any devices still deferring after _this_ round, that must
indicate that some resource they want is not available, and that
should be warned about.

Of course, modules can defer too - and I made some suggestions in my
waffle above the patch about that.
