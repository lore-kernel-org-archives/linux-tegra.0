I did mean the opposite way around.  It may not make sense if you're
targetting a single platform, but it may make sense in a single zImage
kernel.

Consider something like a single zImage kernel that is built with
everything built-in to be able to boot and mount rootfs without
initramfs support on both platform A and platform B.  Both platforms
share some hardware (eg, an I2C GPIO expander) which is built as a
module.  It is a resource provider.  Platform B contains a driver
which is required to boot on platform A, but not platform B (so the
kernel has to have that driver built-in.)  On platform B, there is
a dependency to the I2C GPIO expander device.

I typically see one or two, maybe five maximum on the platforms I have
here, but normally zero.

What's the difference between a dependency which isn't around because
the driver is not built into the kernel but is available as a module,
and a dependency that isn't around because the module hasn't been
loaded yet?

How do you distinguish between those two scenarios?  In the former
scenario, the device will eventually come up when udev loads the
module.  In the latter case, it's a persistent failing case.

... and my argument is that there's _no way_ to know for certain which
deferred probes will be a problem, and which won't.  The only way to
definitely know that is if you disable kernel modules, and require
all drivers to be built into the kernel.

What you can do is print those devices which have failed to probe at
late_initcall() time - possibly augmenting that with reports from
subsystems showing what resources are not available, but that's only
a guide, because of the "it might or might not be in a kernel module"
problem.
