Vinod, V4 of this patch addressed Dan's final minor comments on this
patch. Does it look OK to you? If you could apply it to a topic
branch[1] soon, that would be extremely helpful; I'm waiting for this
patch (and also "dma: add dma_get_any_slave_channel(), for use in
of_xlate()") in order to apply a lot of others.

[1] see notes I posted in the patch:

This patch is a dependency for:
* A series that reworks many of the Tegra drivers.
* A series that enhances ASoC's dmaengine code to support deferred
  probe.

As such, it needs to go into a topic branch on its own, based directly
on 3.13-rc1. If the DMA maintainers ack the patches I'm happy to create
this topic branch myself and send a pull request to the DMA tree. Or the
patches can be applied to a topic branch by the DMA maintainers and I
will merge their topic branch into the Tegra rework branch that I
mentioned.

Thanks.
