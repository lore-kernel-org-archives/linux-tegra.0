The description of this property in pwm-backlight.txt is:

"pwms: OF device-tree PWM specification (see PWM binding[0])
 [0]: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt"

So you can't get any useful infos from that. That's why I propose to add
a tegra specific doc in
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/backlight" directory.

I don't think use panel name instead of board name is a good idea.
Developers may not be familiar with panel names. So if we use panel
name, we have to search and read a lot of manual to find out what the
panel is.

I'd rather putting all stuffs in pwm_bl_tegra.c than separating them.
