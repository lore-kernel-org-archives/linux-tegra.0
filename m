We take spin_lock_irqsave after the descriptor is prepared and before 
writing to TDBR.
Not sure but tomorrow this may become a limitation for drivers to make 
changes to
descriptors if they edit descriptors in host->ops->write_l() call.
Though in this case it is not required here.

Both ways sounds good to me.
But maybe adding a host->ops for descriptor preparation is better way to go,
since that will be the right interface exposed to make changes to 
descriptors.
