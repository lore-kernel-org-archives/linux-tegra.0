The branch name. Thierry's branch has the following:

  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/drm/hdmi-for-3.9
  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/drm/tegra-for-3.9
  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/tegra/drm/for-3.8
  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/tegra/drm/next
  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/tegra/next
  remotes/gitorious_thierryreding_linux/tegra/next-20130122

which of those was it based on?

Also, you simply said it was based on that repo. If you intend Thierry
to apply the patches to his repo/branch, rather than the usual
maintainers of the files you're editing, who you also CC'd, you should
specify that.
