As a result...

I don't understand this part. It looks to me like you are breaking 
compatibility. The driver failing to probe with an old DT is okay?

OS's like OpenSUSE use new DTs with older kernel versions, so you should 
consider how to not break them as well. I guess if all this is optional 
or has been unused, then there shouldn't be a problem.
