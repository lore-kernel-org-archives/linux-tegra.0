The need here is to allow access to headers in
arch/$(hdr-arch)/boot/dts, but passing the directory above that allows
including files as <dts/foo.h> which is nice. That's the rationale for
this patch.

But as I mentioned in other threads, I wonder if we should put the
header files in arch/$(hdr-arch)/boot/dts at all;
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/... would keep the headers adjacent to
the documentation for the bindings themselves, and the headers really
are part of the binding definitions... That would avoid the issue Michal
pointed out, and I think clean up the dtc+cpp include path usage too.

Grant, what are your thoughts?
