Sorry, I did not get it fully. I had two patches, one for fixed one and 
other for tps65910. On which patch, you are seeing issue and which part 
of code?
I like to fix it if it does not conform the DT or your expectation or 
any future enhancement which you are planning.
Little bit more details will help so that I will not repeat the same and 
fix it in my future patches.

Thanks,
Laxman
