Wei: Yes, in OOB mode, it's easy to add a device node in the DT, to pas=
s
the gpio property to brcmfmac driver. But the NO-OOB mode doesn=92t use=
 the
virtual platform device, so we can't pass the gpio to driver. We need t=
o find
a way to support these two mode both.
Could we use the virtual platform device both for OOB and NO-OOB mode? =
so that
we can implement power control in these two mode, and we can add a flag=
s to
control if need to power on or not.
BTW, does that power on sequence is generally for 4329?
