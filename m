abort_flag++ is a bad idea, it will do a read-modify-write on the
variable, and two concurrent read-modify-writes will not result in the
correct value.

In this case you don't care about counting how many cpus have sgis,
you just care if any cpu does.  ACCESS_ONCE(abort_flag) = true will
work fine, because cpus that do not have a pending sgi will not set
the variable to false.
