Just jumping in here to make sure everyone understands the limitations
of the Tegra 2 GART IOMMU we are talking about here. It has no isolation
capabilities and a really small remapping window of 32MB. So it's
impossible to remap every buffer used by the graphics engines. The only
sane way to handle this is to set aside a chunk of stolen system memory
as VRAM and let a memory manager like TTM handle the allocation of
linear regions and GART mappings. This means a more tight integration of
the DRM driver and the IOMMU, where I think that using the IOMMU API
directly and completely controlling the GART from one driver is the
right way to go for a number of reasons, where my biggest concern is
that we can't implement a sane out-of-remapping space when we go through
the dma_map API.

It's too late for me to go into the details now, but I wanted to make it
clear that I think that using the IOMMU only and exclusively from the
DRM driver with a high level of tie in is the way to go. If you want to
know more details I'm available to discuss this matter in the next days.
