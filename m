Hi Andrew,

I think your problem is how to add your core driver to manage device and
host functionality together, and once you find how (through padctl/type-c
controller) to do it based on current code, it will be clear how to use roger
proposal framework at that time.

Most of current core drivers, we use extcon driver (through gpio) or USB
vbus/id pin (through internal registers) to manager roles.
