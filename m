Yes.

Yes, DVFS isn't implemented yet. That could be supported later.

Good point. There is 'opp-supported-hw' device-tree property which seems is intended
for that purpose. I'll take a look at making use of the property in the next revision,
alternatively that could be implemented later in a distinct patch.

What cpufreq governor are you using?

Here is my 'cpufreq-info --stats' output from Tegra30 after a several minutes of idling after boot:

408000:245884, 456000:445, 608000:251, 760000:151, 816000:82, 912000:75, 1000000:163  (561)

And full cpufreq-info:

Make sure that CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_STAT is enabled in the kernels config.

Thank you very much!
