I've decided to pull this in the interest of fairness. I'm taking the
Exynos cpu clock patches, which will need to be updated in the future to
use some new infrastructure for coordinating rate changes across
multiple clock nodes. I'm merging the EMC stuff with the same
expectation that it will need to migrate to the new infrastructure when
it becomes available and we'll get rid of clk_hw_reparent.

Sound good?

Mike
