Hi Viresh:
	First, I agree the new solution you are working on. :)
But actually I don't totally agree my origin patch have design issue.
Because I think governor should have the ability to check whether it ha=
s
been EXIT when doing INIT and it should return error code at that point=
=2E
The design is to make governor code stronger to deal with the case that
governor is reinitialized before EXIT. Just from my view.
Sorry for noise.
