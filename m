So it sounds like the bootloader has already configured the clock to a
certain polarity. If so, why do we need to reconfigure it again?

Or, is this code not duplicating something the bootloader must have
done, but simply informing some HW in the PMC that's receiving SYSCLK
how the clock is configured elsewhere?
