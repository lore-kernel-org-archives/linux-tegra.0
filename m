Just wanted to add a note that the underlying problem is similar to why
I introduced the mux-locked concept. There is no simple way to identify
*exactly* which xfers that need to be unlocked. Going only by call site
is not enough, since the same call in different context may need to be
muxed (in my case) or irq-less (in this case). If someone comes up with
a solution for that, all muxes can be converted to the parent-locked
scheme and we can get rid of a bunch of complexity. I just don't see how
though, all ideas I have come up with I have immediately discarded as way
too invasive, ugly and/or error prone.

Right, I didn't actually think all that far... :-)
