yes, we're trying to solve such issues and have all TI's drivers initialized
from module_init() level, but as usual this process is not so fast. 

You know, some times ago there was no other way to solve boot ordering issues,
but only to play with init levels :) And, as result, right now in drivers/
and sound/ folders there are >77 occurrences of late_initcall().

It will be called after and it will re-triggered deferred device probing.
Now ordering of init calls will be specified by drivers/Makefile
which itself is funny thing.
