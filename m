Clock need to be accessible, but, seems, there is another issue -
if you will try to use gic_driver by just adding compatible string then,
most probably, gic_init_bases() will be called twice:
1: init_IRQ->irqchip_init->of_irq_init()->__gic_init_bases()->gic_init_bases()
2: gic_probe->gic_init_bases()


And GIC data will be replaced on the fly ;P

I can't say definitely - I've just studied it some time ago, but did not try it by myself.
