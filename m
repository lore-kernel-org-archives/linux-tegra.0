I'm not keen on the "*-pm" approach, as such compatible strings aren't
reall describing HW, but rather the SW policy to apply, and really would
only be there to bodge around a structural issue we have in Linux today
w.r.t. the device model split and probe ordering.

The "nvidia,tegra210-agic" string can be taken as describing any
Tegra-210 specific integration quirks, though I agree that's also not
fantastic for extending PM support beyond Tegra 210 and variants
thereof.

So maybe the best approach is bailing out in the presence of clocks
and/or power domains after all, on the assumption that nothing today has
those properties, though I fear we may have problems with that later
down the line if/when people describe those for the root GIC to describe
those must be hogged, even if not explicitly managed.

Thanks,
Mark.
