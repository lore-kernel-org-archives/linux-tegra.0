Since both the Tegra DT patches and this driver all rely on a new header 
added by patch 1/4, I guess this whole series needs to be applied in one 
branch. I think it makes sense to apply it to the Tegra since it's 
likely to have more conflicts there and fewer in the thermal 
maintainer's tree. It can be applied in a topic branch that can be 
merged into the thermal maintainer's tree if required to resolve 
conflicts there.

Rui, Eduardo, do you agree?

Can any/all of those be const?

I don't pretend to know anything about the soctherm HW, but I see no 
gross issues in the code structure, so,
