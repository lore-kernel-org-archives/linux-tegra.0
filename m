I have no objection in particular. Specifically for pinmux, the values
seem pretty obvious, so I'm not sure what extra the comment could
convey, but I'll take a look at any proposed patch:-)

It doesn't sound like that's what we want either; we should know exactly
when the device is added/removed, based on when the relevant
clocks/supplies/... are turned on/off.

How does that GPIO get manipulated right now? I assume you must be
manually configuring it via sysfs after boot or something? If so,
perhaps it's best to just leave out the WiFi node until it works
automatically.

There was a thread on this topic on LAKML recently. I didn't really
follow it, so I don't know if there was a useful resolution. I think it
was "mmc: add support for power-on sequencing through DT", although
there may have been other related threads. It was possibly tangentially
related to power-sequences-in-DT...

I'd tend to leave it out then.
