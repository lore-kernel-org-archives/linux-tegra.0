This patch series description fails to describe why you need a brand
new subsystem for this instead of either using one of the current
ones, or adapting it to fit the needs you have.

Primarily, I'm wondering what's missing from drivers/devfreq to fit your needs?

The series also doesn't seem to provide any kind of indication how
this will be used by end points. You have one driver for one SoC that
just contains large tables that are parsed at probe time, but no
driver hooks anywhere that will actually change any settings depending
on use cases. Also, the bindings as posted don't seem to include any
of this kind of information. So it's hard to get a picture of how this
is going to be used in reality, which makes it hard to judge whether
it is a good solution or not.

Overall, exposing all of this to software is obviously a nightmare
from a complexity point of view, and one in which it will surely be
very very hard to make the system behave properly for generic
workloads beyond benchmark tuning.

Having more information about the above would definitely help tell if
this whole effort is a step in the right direction, or if it is
needless complexity that is better solved in other ways.
