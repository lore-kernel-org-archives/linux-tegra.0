Technically, the GMI/SNOR controller supports 8 chip-selects, however,
unlike some devices, it appears that software has to select the active
chip-select. Although this sounds odd, I believe that the idea is that
in order to support devices greater than 256MB (external address space
for available NOR/async devices) you can use the chip-selects to page
through memory greater than this 256MB range. At least that it my
(limited) understanding!
