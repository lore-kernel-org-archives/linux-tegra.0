Oh so you don't have separate interrupts for the instances?
Thanks for clarifying that.

On omaps, each bank is a separate driver instance with it's own
interrupt. Maybe really all we need to do is get rid of the "bank"
naming, I think that's left over from 15 years ago when we did not
have separate driver instances. It seems we should s/bank/ddata/
on the driver to avoid confusion.

Grygorii, any comments?
