Oh, I guess the fact it's include makes it a bit more painful.

You could deal with it in Kconfig reasonably easily by having each of
DEBUG_*_UART select a config option indicating how to compile code that
includes DEBUG_LL_INCLUDE, and then have the Makefiles set up asflags
based on those. Still, that would be a lot of work and this patch is
simpler.
