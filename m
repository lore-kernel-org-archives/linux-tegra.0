On an x86 (32 bits) laptop hibernate also broke in v3.13-rc3. On that
machine hibernation itself worked, or at least seemed to work, but the
machine would basically stop after thawing (directly after loading the
hibernation image).

And reverting commit 5a87182aa21d ("cpufreq: suspend governors on syste=
m
suspend/hibernate"), on top of v3.13-rc3, also lead to a successful
hibernation/thaw cycle.
