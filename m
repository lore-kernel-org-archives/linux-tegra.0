But it really doesn't do that.  Also making it do so doesn't help much
in the cases where things can happen asynchronously (system
suspend/resume, runtime PM).

If, instead, there was a way to specify a functional dependency at the
device registration time, it might be used to change the order of
everything relevant, including probe.  That should help to reduce the
noise you're referring to.

If the dependency could only be discovered at the probe time, the
order of things might be changed in response to letting the driver
core know about it rather than "just in case", which should be more
efficient.

Thanks,
Rafael
