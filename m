I typically rely on the disto restoring settings from asound.state 
during boot, and saving them from HW during shutdown. I then put that 
asound.state on any filesystems I create.

Adding UCM configurations sounds like it'd be a better alternative, 
presuming there's some automatic way for the distro to correlate the HW 
name to the UCM file name and automatically apply it during boot or 
audio startup.
