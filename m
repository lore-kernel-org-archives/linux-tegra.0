That should be OK; adding more entries in interrupt-names is backwards 
compatible. Still, since the HW is fixed, it would be nice to just get 
the complete list documented up front if possible.

Yes, that would be (b) above.

However, please do note (a): I expect that splitting things up will turn 
out to be a mistake, as it has for other HW modules in the past. I would 
far rather see a single hsp node in DT, since there is a single HSP 
block in HW. Sure that block has multiple sub-functions. However, there 
is common logic that affects all of those sub-functions and binds 
everything into a single HW module. If you represent the HW module using 
multiple different DT nodes, it will be hard to correctly represent that 
common logic. Conversely, I see no real advantage to splitting up the DT 
node. I strongly believe we should have a single "hsp" node in DT.

Internally, the SW driver for that node can be structured however you 
want; it could register with multiple subsystems (mailbox, ...) with 
just one struct device, or the HSP driver could be an MFD device with 
sub-drivers for each separate piece of functionality the HW implements. 
All this can easily be done even while using a single DT node. And 
furthermore, we can add this SW structure later if/when we actually need 
it; in other words, there's no need to change your current patches right 
now, except to remove the nvidia,hsp-function DT property.
