Going over the patches again I realized that Jetson TK1 is actually one
such case. The PCI host bridge controller is configured to run root port
0 using two lanes, and root port 1 using one lane. However, only one
lane is connected to each port. Root port 0 goes to the miniPCIe slot,
which takes a single lane (PEX4), while root port 1 goes to the onboard
NIC, which takes a single lane (PEX2) as well. x1 + x1 is an unsupported
configuration for the root complex, though, hence why it is configured
to be x2 + x1.

I've tested that both the onboard NIC as well as a miniPCIe card work
correctly with the setup.

So I think the wording in the binding, as well as the example, are
correct. So I left the original wording in place, but instead added a
couple more examples so that we have one per SoC generation, which will
hopefully clarify what properties should and shouldn't be used.
