I had an idea about how we could maybe implement a generic ECAM
mechanism that provides for this kind of mapping as well. Basically,
every mechanism that can be covered by such an implementation would in
one way or another specify the above five fields, so how about designing
it in a way that the driver could define the fields that encode the
information, so for Tegra, something along these lines:

	struct pci_ecam_map pci_ecam_tegra =3D {
		.register =3D {  0,  7 },
		.extended =3D { 24, 27 },
		.function =3D {  8, 10 },
		.device   =3D { 11, 15 },
		.bus      =3D { 16, 23 },
	}

For standard ECAM, something like this:

	struct pci_ecam_map pci_ecam_standard =3D {
		.register =3D {  0,  7 },
		.extended =3D {  8, 11 },
		.function =3D { 12, 14 },
		.device   =3D { 15, 19 },
		.bus      =3D { 20, 27 },
	};
