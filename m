Yes, thanks.

The SYSCLK is super clock that was connected to COP subsystem. It can't
be disabled when system is running. The boot loader had initialized it
and brought it to kernel. We follow the HW description in DT of the
polarity of SCLK to re-configure and re-init again. Then the PMC can
clock gate it when system go into suspend state.

And it can't be set it up by a single register write. It's a HW control
sequence. (Actually lots of PMC code have similar sequence.)
