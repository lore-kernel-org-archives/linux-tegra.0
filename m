Ok. That sounds a little surprising to me, but I am admittedly not
familiar with this binding and PCI more generally. I'll dig a bit
deeper.

Labelling something as simple-bus just to get an implicit
of_platform_populate is an abuse of simple-bus. If you have a driver for
handling the device as something more complex than a simple-bus, it
absolutely must do that probing itself (because there could be some
ordering requirement on re-initialisation of the bus).

If the sub-nodes don't make sense on their own, the "simple-bus" string
is not appropriate regardless.

One thing I've been hoping/trying to do for a while (with little success
so far) was to split simple-bus handling into a simple MMIO bus driver,
which exposes and/or blows up in cases like this.

Ok.

I guess the ordering of this w.r.t. other nodes isn't too important.
While I find it surprising, at least it shouldn't cause issues in the
DTB itself.

However, it would be nice if we aligned all dts a bit better long-term.

Thanks,
Mark.
