Why not just use the pre-defined names here? There is a pre-defined name
for "default", "idle" and "sleep" and then you can use the following
APIs and avoid the lookup of the state ...

pinctrl_pm_select_default_state()
pinctrl_pm_select_idle_state()
pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state()

Note for i2c [0][1], I used "default" as the active/on state (which I
know is not that descriptive) and then used 'idle' as the suspended
state. This way we don't need any custom names.

Cheers
Jon
