Your goal should be to get rid of iomap.h though...

Agreed.

Here is what I mentioned previously. This removes the static mapping from 
the platforms. This is untested and probably breaks on different DEBUG_LL 
options. For now, platforms call debug_ll_io_init, but once all platforms 
are converted, this can be called from devicemaps_init.
