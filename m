Hi Lorenzo,

May I upstream this stuff first? I can promise to you I will re-work a
common CPUs and cluster power sync wrappers (platform_power_ops) for all
Tegra series that based on the generic framework. Because we didn't have
this work in Tegra tree yet and we indeed need it for supporting cluster
power down and switching.

But it need lots of time for re-work, testing and verification. And I
have lots of patches that need the function of cpu suspend that be
introduced in this patch series to support platform suspend for Tegra.

So I am asking the permission here for upstream this series first and I
will continue the job to come out a common CPUs and cluster power sync
wrappers for Tegra that we indeed need it to support cluster power down
and switching.

Thanks,
Joseph
