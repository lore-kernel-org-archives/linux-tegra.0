All,

This is where I'm at with trying to clean up the SDHCI mess, and sort out
issues I've noticed when trying to get UHS support working on CuBoxes.
This is my full patch set, but I recommend not applying patch 37 as there
appears to be a hardware issue preventing it working reliably.

In any case, patches 0-33 inclusive are the SDHCI clean up, based against
v3.15-rc1.  Patches 34 and 35 are Olof's Wifi support, 36 is my fix against
those, and 38 adds the Broadcom Wifi and BT support for CuBox.

The questions over how to handle these devices were never properly settled,
so I recommend against merging patch 34 onwards.  As for the rest, I'm not
planning on any further work, so it may be a good idea for people to
consider testing them with a view to getting them merged.
