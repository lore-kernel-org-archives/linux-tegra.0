Mixing strings and integers in a property isn't "allowed" (by convention
of DT bindings reviewers - as you noticed, dtc will happily compile it);
there are practical issues with attempting to do so, such as causing the
integer values to be unaligned, and thus causing the current integer
parsing code to fail, etc.
