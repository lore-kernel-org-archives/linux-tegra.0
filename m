My comment about forcing recalc rates is limited to "a clock that can 
adjust its rate (eg: implements a .set_rate callback) must also 
implement .recalc_rate.". As you mention, this is really a function of 
whether the parent rate can change or not.

I stand corrected on my orthogonal point that "if .set_rate is not 
implemented, we can assume the rate matches the parent".

I agree the with the need for recalc_rates you mentioned above (parent 
changes rate and it will affect children). But I still don't get why you 
have to recalc the rate of the clock that you just set. Can you please 
give an example?

No. This is for debugging the software.

I never questioned the need for recalc rates. I also didn't make the 
above blanket statement -- in fact, I was saying the opposite.

My point was whether we needed to check for .recalc_rates or if we can 
just look for .set_rate to figure out if the clock will take the 
parent's rate. Your fixed factor div-2 example corrected me on that point.

Yes, please. This was one of the main points of my previous email.

Do you do a recalc on the clock that the clk_set_rate() is called on? 
You only seem to make the preemptive calls on the children. Which makes 
sense (But I have one concern. I will get to it at the end).

Yeah, I think you mistook my comment that was specific to clocks that 
implement set rate as applying to all clocks.

This is the original point I raised. To be clear, I'm not denying the 
need for .recalc_rate. I'm just saying that it's not related to 
.set_rate(). As you mentioned in your response above, this is not really 
a function of whether a clock can set it's rate or not. It's a function 
of whether a parent's rate can change. So, I don't see why we should 
arbitrarily tie it to .set_rate.

For example, there are several PLLs in MSM that get their input from a 
fixed crystal oscillator. There's no point in implementing recalc_rate 
for them (except for figuring out the rate during init).

Which brings me to another point:
I think we should split out the "figure out the clock's rate during 
boot/init" to a separate op. That operation by definition has to go 
through many registers, and if it's a rate settable clock, go through 
all the possible frequencies to figure out the rate. That seems too 
expensive for something that's done often like .recalc_rate. In pretty 
much every other call to .recalc_rate, it doesn't really need to check 
the hardware. It just needs to recompute the rate based on the software 
model of that clock. If we do add this new op (say, .sync), the expense 
of calling .recalc_rate after calling .set_rate would be much much lower 
and I won't really complain much about it (would still be nice to not do 
it).
