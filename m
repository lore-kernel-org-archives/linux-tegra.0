Hi Jiri,

> don't seem to see any followup patchset doing that?

The platform data is filled by specific march-* board definition data.
In this case some I would say a tegra board. So it's fine not having a
patchset setting the quirk (as it is per board, and maybe per
version/manufacturer).

Other than that I would love seeing the same for the device tree
binding if we add this to the struct i2c_hid_platform_data.

BTW, Jiri, the aim of the patch was to be able to add the quirk
HID_QUIRK_NO_INIT_INPUT_REPORTS to some of the i2c-hid devices.
However, the Windows driver uses this by default, so I already told to
Bibek that we could just drop the related calls in
i2c_hid_init_reports().

Cheers,
Benjamin
