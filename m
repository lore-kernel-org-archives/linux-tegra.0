Do you have any suggestions then?

I have had a look at the ARM TRMs and although I see that they do show
the functional clock, there is no mention of whether there are any other
clocks need in order to interface to the GIC (ie. bus clock). I know
that for other SoCs such as OMAP it is common to have both a functional
clock and interface clock. So I believe this is fairly common.
