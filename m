It's really unfortunate, and this is very likely not the last time
we're going to see something like this.

Backwards compatibility is only needed where there actually are users
of it. Are you absolutely 100% sure that there will not be such a
case? Trimslice users? Out-of-tree DTS:es that now need to be fixed up
or they will break? This isn't the same thing as in-kernel interface
changes where we say "out of tree, out of mind".

If you have to stay compatible, then I suggest you try to fill in
local driver variables with derivatives of the old properties (and
directly from the newer properties where you can). I haven't looked at
the specifics here so I don't know how hard it might be.

If you are 100% sure that you don't have to stay compatible, then you
can remove the code handling the old bindings. Still, even then I am a
little worried about dependencies (and more importantly conflicts)
between these dtsi changes and others done by tegra platform code for
this release. I suppose that can be resolved by having this as a base
of any DT changes for tegra if needed.
