The view I had when adding a compatible field was that the controllers
that use this binding essentially inherits and extends it, so having
this as a common compatible seems like the right thing to do. It also
gives an easy reference ('see binding for
"matrix-keyboard-controller"' from the other binding, etc).

It's pushing the limits for it, yes. Dmitry, should I start a shared C
file for this? If so, where? drivers/input/keyboard/keymap.c?

Yes, caller is expected to free. Dmitry doesn't like devm_alloc so I
guess having a free function could be a decent idea (I had it
open-coded in the driver that uses this, will switch that over too).
