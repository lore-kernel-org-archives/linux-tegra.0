Based on this description I have a few questions:
1. Why we don't use SCMI notifications for this purpose?
2. Is it safe to assume that there was no extra frequency change
    during that polling sampling period?
3. Shouldn't we sample 2x faster than the changes that we try to
    observe?
4. IIRC there was some extension in the SCMI protocol for performance
    domains which allows to expose the stats like the one above but in
    the shared memory. Why we couldn't use this? It would be more robust.
