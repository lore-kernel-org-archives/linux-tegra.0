I repeat: Why store that value in a global variable? It's constant.

I think that change needs to happen after patch 7. At this point in the
series, LP1 doesn't work on any chip. After patch 7, it will work on all
chips.

If you don't make that change, you should move this change into patch 5,
but only enable LP1 for Tegra30, then make patch 6 also enable it for
Tegra20, then make patch 7 also enable it for Tegra114. That's a lot
more complex, so just moving the change above into a new patch after
patch 7 seems better.

Note: You must assume that the DT changes are all checked in before any
of the code changes, so the code needs to work correctly even if the DT
contains the data that allows usage of LP1 before the driver actually
implements LP1.
