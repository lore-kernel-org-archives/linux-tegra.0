Oh, that should be "accessing".

Oh, the next patch is just adding the entry to the .dtsi file for the
AHB, so no surprise it doesn't add a binding document for the SMMU!

I see that with this patch, the driver still expects the DMA window to
be represented as a reg property (IORESOURCE_MEM), so if we add a
binding document to this patch it won't be very consistent either:-( And
then, there's the issue of whether the SMMU should be it's own device or
a child of some MC device, since there's non-SMMU functionality in these
registers too. This makes all the SMMU rework need a little more thought.

So, I propose dropping this patch from this series, since this series is
all about adding the AHB driver. We should move this patch to a series
relating to the SMMU driver.
