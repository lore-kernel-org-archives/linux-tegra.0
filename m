From: Hiroshi Doyu <hdoyu-DDmLM1+adcrQT0dZR+AlfA@public.gmane.org>

The IOMMU node's reg property contains completely bogus values! Somehow,
this had no practical effect, despite the fact the IOMMU driver appears
to be writing to those registers. I suppose that since no HW modules is
actually at that address, the writes simply had no effect.

Note that I'm not CCing stable here, even though the problem exists as
far back as v3.9, simply because this patch doesn't fix any observed
issue, and I don't want to run the risk of suddenly writing to some
registers and causing a regression.

Kevin, Olof, if you could apply this directly for 3.13, that's be awesome.
