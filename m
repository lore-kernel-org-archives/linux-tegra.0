Hmm, indeed.

Even if PLL_C rate will be adjusted, it will be higher than the PLL_P.. won't
it? That's likely to be good enough.

Do you know if any of the available CCLK parents has a glitch-less rate
switching? I.e. CPU won't hang on the rate switch.

There is other possible 600MHz source, the PLL_M. Can we use it? This one also
may become dynamic if we'll consider implementing the memory scaling, but the
memory frequency probably will fit the transition role pretty well.
