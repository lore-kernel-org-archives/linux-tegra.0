It's a bit ironic that you've chosen GPIO as an example there.  The
"new" GPIO API (the gpiod_* stuff) only has a fwnode way to get the
gpio descriptor.  There's no of_* method.

I'd like to use the gpiod_* stuff, but I feel that my options are
rather limited: either use fwnode_get_named_gpiod() with
&dev->of_node->fwnode, which seems like a hack by going underneath
the covers of how fwnode is (partially) implemented with DT, or by
using of_get_named_gpio() and the converting the gpio number to a
descriptor via gpio_to_desc().  Both feel very hacky.

If ACPI already handles GPIOs internally, then I'm left wondering
why GPIO descriptor stuff went down the fwnode route at all - it
seems rather pointless in this case, and it seems to make the use
of the gpiod* interfaces where we _do_ need to use it (DT) harder
and more hacky.
