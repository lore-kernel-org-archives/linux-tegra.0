I like the concept and novel approach.

Yeah, this is the opposite of what we'd really like. Ideally, we would
have a solution that works for modules too. However, we're no worse
off. We pretty much build-in dependencies to avoid module ordering
problems.

Perhaps we need to make the probing on-demand rather than simply on
device<->driver match occurring.

Ideally, of_platform_populate is not explicitly called by each
platform. So I think we need to make this work for the default case.

That's certainly compelling.
