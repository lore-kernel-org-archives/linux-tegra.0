To me, working back from address to ID then using the ID to calculate
some other addresses seems far more icky than just calculating all the
addresses based off of one ID. But, I suppose this doesn't make a huge
practical difference.

Oh right, I missed some 8s and 0s that looked the same!

But the existing driver works without /any/ devices, let alone one per
port.
