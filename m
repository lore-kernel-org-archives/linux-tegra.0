I think you can use a small-integer port number as an address by 
defining the intermediate address space properly, and using appropriate 
ranges above and below.  Here's a swag at how that would look.

I present three versions, using different choices for the intermediate 
address space encoding.  The intermediate address space may seem 
somewhat artificial, in that it decouples the "linear pass through of 
ranges" between the lower PCI address space and the upper CPU address 
space.  But in another sense, it accurately reflects that fact that the 
bus bridge "slices and dices" that linear address space into 
non-contiguous pieces.

Note that I'm also fixing a problem that I neglected to mention earlier 
- namely the fact that config space is part of the child PCI address 
space so it must be passed through.

Version A - 3 address cells:  In this version, the intermediate address 
space has 3 cells:  port#, address type, offset.  Address type is
   0 : root port
   1 : config space
   2 : extended config space
   3 : I/O
   4 : non-prefetchable memory
   5 : prefetchable memory.

The third cell "offset" is necessary so that the size field has a number 
space that can include it.

Version B - 2 address cells:  In this first version, the intermediate
address space has 2 cells:  port#, offset.  The address type (I/O, mem,
etc) is the high digit of in the offset:
    Offset 0....... : Root port
    Offset 1....... : config
    Offset 2....... : extended config
    Offset 3....... : I/O
    Offset 4....... : non-prefetchable memory
    Offset 5....... : prefetchable memory.

Version C - 2 address cells, 0 size cells (!) : In this version we hide the size component in the intermediate space.  I don't know if that will actually work, but my guess is that it probably would.  The intermediate address space is like version A with the omission of the offset field.  The intermediate address just specifies the port number and the address type.

In version C, you might even be able to include the ctrl register offset as a second entry in the reg property.
