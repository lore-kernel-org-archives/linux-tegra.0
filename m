I'd say no, for three reasons:

1. It requires no run-time workaround - by that I mean, it doesn't require
   software modification of the ICIALLUIS operation.

2. It only requires a bit set in a secure-only-accessible diagnostic
   register before the MMU is brought online.

3. This is the cruncher for this erratum - when we bring up a SMP system,
   we need this erratum applied before the caches and MMU are enabled.
   Why?  Because when we enable the caches and MMU, we have to then be
   able to reliably issue the ICIALLUIS operation.

   We know that we can't run platform specific code before these are
   brought up, so we can't go running SMC instructions this early on
   from the kernel code.

   As previously pointed out, having the work-around enabled in the
   kernel may not be appropriate for other platforms because even though
   they have a pre-r3p0 CPU, they may have fixed the problem in their
   silicon.

Therefore, for all of the above reasons, we _can't_ have this in a kernel
designed to run on multiple different platforms.

I think what you're digging up here is one of the biggest obstacles we
still have, created through a "freedom of design" and the desire by
distros to have a single kernel image booting on multiple platforms.

This has the advantage that you (in theory) know which work-arounds are
appropriate for the revisions of CPU cores that you have on your platform.
So, although this would mean duplicating the erratum throughout the
platform code (which is distasteful) it would nevertheless work.

I think that's a very complex solution, and more fragile than just
duplicating the errata.

That sounds platform specific again... I know that OMAP has to talk to
the secure world to tell it how to boot the secondary CPUs, so this
solution is specific to Tegra.
