Just to clarify: I wasn't suggesting that these patches are merged for
v4.16 via the Tegra tree, only that I carry them in the Tegra tree for a
little while so that we can get broader testing and fix things up in
case they break. My proposal was to then send a pull request for
inclusion in the PCI tree. linux-next can deal with this type of
scenario just fine because it will simply see the same branch twice and
ignore the second one.

If you prefer to merge directly via the PCI tree that works for me too.
