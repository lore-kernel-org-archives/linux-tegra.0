I took a look at your amba branch, but all I can see in there is:

6cfa627 ARM: 7079/1: spi: Fix builderror in spi-pl022.c
1c3be36 PM: add runtime PM support to MMCI
92b97f0 PM: add runtime PM support to core Primecell driver

which don't seem to touch Versatile or Realview. Am I looking in the wrong
place?

Cheers,

Will
