I'm not sure I understand what you mean but we had already tried this
way and for this, you can refer to below link,
               http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel-PD4FTy7X32lNgt0PjOBp9y5qC8QIuHrW@public.gmane.org/msg22555.html

but this way had been pointed out by drm guys because the pages could
be used through gem object after that pages had been freed by free()
anyway their pointing was reasonable and I'm trying another way, this
is the way that the pages to user space has same life time with dma
operation. in other word, if dma completed access to that pages then
also that pages will be freed. actually drm-based via driver of
mainline kernel is using same way
