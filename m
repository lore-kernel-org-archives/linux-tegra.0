Can we please name this nvidia,tegra20-pcie.txt to match the naming of
all the other Tegra bindings.

Since there's more than one range now, that should specify how many
entries are required and what they represent.

Those shouldn't be optional. If the board has no regulator, the board's
.dts should provide a fixed always-on regulator that those properties
can refer to, so that the driver can always get() those regulators.

That should be "disabled"; sorry for providing a bad example.

As mentioned above, that if statement should be removed, since the
regulators shouldn't be optional.

Those could be devm_regulator_get(). Then tegra_pcie_remove() wouldn't
have to put() them.

Shouldn't the DT indicate which ports are used? I assume there's some
reason that the existing driver allows that to be configured, rather
than always enabling all ports. At least, enumeration time wasted on
non-existent ports springs to mind, and perhaps attempting to enable
port 1 when port 0 is x4 and using all the lanes would cause errors in
port 0?
