That's a problem you solved with coupled C-states (ie your example in
the cover letter), where the primary waits for other CPUs to be reset
before issuing the power down command, right ? At that point in time 
secondaries cannot wake up (?) and if wfi (ie power down) aborts you just
take the secondaries out of reset and restart executing simultaneously,
correct ? It mirrors the suspend behaviour, which is easier to deal with
than completely random idle paths.

It is true that this should be managed by the PM HW; if HW is not
capable of managing these situations things get nasty as you highlighted.

And it is also true ldrex/strex on cacheable memory might not be available in
those early warm-boot stages. I came up with a locking algorithm on
strongly ordered memory to deal with that, but I am still not sure it is
something we really really need.

I will test coupled C-state code ASAP, and come back with feedback.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
