I actually built these kernel revisions with module support
disabled to speed up the builds, and no modules are being
downloaded in the LAVA job.

If you have a public URL with your known working kernel zImage
and dtb, let me know so I could re-run the same test LAVA boot
test to see if I get the same results as you (i.e. no hang).
