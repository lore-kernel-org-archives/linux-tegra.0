No. The IRQ_TYPE_NONE is a hysterical leftover.

Oh, yes.

Simply because any driver which is not aware of that inversion will
trip over the issue that it requests by the best of its knowledge
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH while it should actually request
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW due to the inversion.

Are you really going to make all possibly affected drivers aware of
that? Good luck!

That's why we want to move such stuff to core code. Assume the
following scenario:

    driverX which works perfectly fine on SoCA is reused for SoCB
    where the inverter sits between the device and the SoCB irq
    controller.

With your DT scheme the whole thing falls flat on the nose simply
because neither the driverX nor the core code is aware of the
incompability.

So driverX is happily using the IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH setting which was
used when the driver was written and the core works nicely with that
because the irq chips supports IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH. Just the fact that
the inverter is in the hardware results in an infinite interrupt
storm. Are you going to handle the bug reports and "remote" debug
sessions for this kind of crap?

Fuck no. You don't want to deal with this and that's why it is way
better to build that kind of support into the core where everything
which trips over the issue tells the random driver user/developer
what's wrong.

Dammit. I explained you very detailed WHY this is useful aside of the
inverted logic situation. Is it that hard to understand?

This usecase clearly shows a shortcoming at the core level along with
a potential for consolidation. So why are you trying to convince me
that this can be solved with some DT/device drivers hackery?

When will you SoC folks ever understand that nothing on your
SoCs/board is special? I'm telling that you for years but you simply
refuse to get a gripe.

Thanks,
