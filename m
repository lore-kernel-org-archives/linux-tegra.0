Don't worry, I didn't send that email to make you postpone this change.
Giving the fuzziness of reproduction, and the flakiness (esp. on Armadillo)
of the boot loader, and these are old SoCs, please go ahead.

Seems to make no difference.

I think so.

Corruption pattern ranges from lock up, over "Error: unrecognized/unsupported
machine ID", to booting almost completely, but lacking a few devices due to
a corrupted DTB. Been like that as long as I remember, i.e. since I got the
board ca. 1 year ago. Boots fine (100%) with kexec.
