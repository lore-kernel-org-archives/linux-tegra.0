I don't see anything in the U-Boot driver that is equivalent to the 
kernel's NVQUIRK_ENABLE_SDHCI_SPEC_300. I assume that means the 
controller advertises an early spec version when in U-Boot, which simply 
means U-Boot doesn't know to take advantage of any faster transfer modes 
enabled by later specification versions, but I'm not entirely sure what 
effect the following kernel code has on the HW:

Perhaps the kernel driver should pulse the controller's CAR reset signal 
in probe() to ensure that the HW is in a known state?
