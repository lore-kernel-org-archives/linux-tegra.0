Ah, I see. FPGA based devices often have incomplete PCI support so that
explains why you can't test it. The board also appears to have a
PCIe mini port though, so anything that you could plug in there should
also support LSI interrupts.

I hope we can make the PCI host probing architecture independent one day,
instead of each architecture implementing their own. I'd say better put
that property in there so we don't have to change it in case the future
generic code will need it. It is part of the binding at
http://www.openfirmware.org/1275/bindings/pci/pci-express.txt after all.

Note that we should generally not make /code/ be written with the
anticipation of a future extension, but anything that concerns interfaces
to code outside of the kernel (firmware or user space) is best written
in a conservative way to allow later changes.
