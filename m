I was planning to use it from within the probe of a driver wishing to
use PM_CLK framework in general. Adding them automatically could be
nice, but like you have pointed out, some drivers want specific control
over certain clocks. May be having a "pm-clocks" node in the DT would be
needed for something like this. Or some way of saying it can be
controlled by PM_CLK.

That's what I thought you meant and sounds good to me.

Another option is to add another variable called "max_clocks" which if
-1 means there is no user max and defer to the 'count' for the number of
clocks to be added. Where 'count' is the number of clocks in the DT blob
for the device. Obviously if you set max_clocks = 200 and there are only
2 clocks in the DT blob only 2 would be added.

It would also be possible to pass the 'added' number of clocks to the
filter and so the filter could decided if it wanted to keep matching or
not. However, you could equally keep track of that with the void *data
variable yourself and so may be that is redundant.

If it is not something that we can sort out now, then I would rather not
added it. However, may be a wrapper would not be so bad after all. Even
with the above proposal of another variable called 'max_clocks' I would
be tempted to split the functions into two, for example,
of_pm_clk_add_clks() and of_pm_clk_add_clks_match(), where the later
uses the filter and the former does not.
