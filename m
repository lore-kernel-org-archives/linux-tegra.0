In next-20150515, this patch causes silent boot failures on NVIDIA Tegra
ARM systems. There isn't even any earlyprintk. Reverting this one patch
solves this.

I was a bit surprised that cgroups would cause such an issue, but
looking at a normal kernel boot, I guess cgroup does get initialized
very early:

Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.
[    0.000000] Booting Linux on physical CPU 0x0
[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu
[    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuacct

Anyway, I'll try to track down what the problem is, but if someone
familiar with this patch could give it a look, that'd be very useful,
since I'm not at all familiar with this code or feature.
