Do we actually need to specifically enumerate all the ranges; would
just "ranges;" be simpler?

I'm still not convinced that using the address of the port's registers
is the correct way to represent each port. The port index seems much
more useful.

The main reason here is that there are a lot of registers that contain
fields for each port - far more than the combination of this node's
reg and ctrl-offset (which I assume is an address offset for just one
example of this issue) properties can describe. The bit position and
bit stride of these fields isn't necessarily the same in each
register. Do we want a property like ctrl-offset for every single type
of field in every single shared register that describes the location
of the relevant data, or just a single "port ID" bit that can be
applied to anything?

(Perhaps this isn't so obvious looking at the TRM since it doesn't
document all registers, and I'm also looking at the Tegra30
documentation too, which might be more exposed to this - I haven't
correlated all the documentation sources to be sure though)

The values here appear identical for both ports. Surely they should
describe just the parts of the overall address space that have been
assigned/delegated to the individual port/bridge?

Note that initial indications are that the overall controller receives
transactions for those address ranges, and standard PCIe bridge
registers are used to steer chunks of these address ranges into the
individual downstream ports/busses. Hence, standard PCIe documentation
should indicate how to do this.

What is it that drives the need for each port to be a 'struct device'?
The current driver supports 2 host ports, yet there's only a single
struct device for it. Does the DT code assume a 1:1 mapping between
struct device and DT node that represents the child bus? If so,
perhaps it'd be better to rework that code to accept a DT node as a
parameter and call it multiple times, rather than accept a struct
device as a parameter and hence need multiple devices?
