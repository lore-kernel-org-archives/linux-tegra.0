Overall, a good change. For host1x part:

Acked-By: Terje Bergstrom <tbergstrom@nvidia.com>

This patch does not change the behavior, but we have in original code
the problem that we don't flush the MC queue when resetting an engine.
This can cause some memory writes to not hit memory. There was an
earlier discussion on that, but we seem to have lost track of the issue.
