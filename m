Sorry for the delay. I've upgraded u-boot to U-Boot
2015.10-rc2-00439-g03d8714 using the tegra u-boot flashing scripts.
FWIW, I did have to revert 620776d734e4 ("tftp: adjust settings to be
suitable for 100Mbit ethernet") to get TFTP working again.

Anyways, it hangs at the exact same spot[1] with the newer version of
u-boot. If remove the modules from the initrd or just disable
CONFIG_SND_HDA_TEGRA it boots fine. This weekend I'll try to debug
this module manually and see if I draw any conclusions.

Cheers,

Tyler
