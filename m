All the more impressive. =3D)

Currently I think coherent memory would do just as well as cacheable
memory, maybe even better given that we wouldn't need the cache
maintenance. However, I think cacheable memory might come in handy if
ever the ->map_sg() callback gets implemented, because it would allow us
to batch up a bunch of PTE writes and flush whole pages in one go.

Unfortunately I don't have the tools handy to provide any numbers, so
the above is really just guesswork. Cc'ing Rob Clark who, I think, did
performance measurements a while ago. Not sure if those included
coherent vs. cacheable memory, though.
