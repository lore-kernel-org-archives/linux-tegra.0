I was assuming that you'd have one 'struct device' per client in all
cases, so you'd have a unique association between a swgroup/id tuple
and the device pointer that you pass into the dma-mapping and IOMMU APIs.

I wasn't thinking of adding the entire table to the IOMMU node, that would
indeed achieve nothing compare to having the table in the driver source.

What I was trying to get at was whether you could make it work without
a table whatsoever, by doing the DT IOMMU reference on the ID level rather
than the more coarse SWGROUP level, and doing the memory controller
settings (latency allowance) separately from that.

As above, my expectation was to have a separate device node per client.

I'm not entirely buying this. You can clearly print the number and
have the person debugging the driver manually look up the ID in a table,
even if you don't have a separate struct device per ID. Obviously
printing a cleartext identifier is a bit nicer, but you wouldn't
add the table just for this purpose, just like we don't have tables
to map irq/gpio/dma/... numbers to strings in general.

Ok, I see. The part that I'm missing here is how the client driver
knows its number, as you write that we don't have a device node per
client. Do you have a particular binding in mind already?

This again comes down to the question of whether you have one device
node per client or one device node per group, so let's focus on that
question and then make a decision based on that. The other discussion
points are at this stage not important, so if you can convince me that
doing one node per group is better than one node per id, I'd be happy
to take your patches (with a summary of the discussion added to the
merge commit).

The IOMMU core explictly understands the concept of IOMMU groups that
share a translation between multiple clients, and this would seem like
the best fit for the hardware you describe, but evidently you came to
a different conclusion, as you have more knowledge of the details behind
it. I can see that most groups have only one ID, but there are a few
that have up to four clients:

      3       2 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_HC,
      2       2 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_NV,

      2       3 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_EPP,
      1       3 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_ISP2,
      1       3 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_ISP2B,
      1       3 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_MPE,
      1       4 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_NV,
      6       4 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_VDE,
      2       4 +               .swgroup = TEGRA_SWGROUP_VI,

Are all of these devices where you'd naturally describe each
group as a single device node in DT?
