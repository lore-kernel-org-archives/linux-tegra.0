Yes that would be the correct thing to do I agree. However, the problem
is that if we do this, then after the patch "irqdomain: Don't set type
when mapping an IRQ" is applied, we may break interrupts for some
existing device-tree binaries that have bad configuration (such as omap4
and tegra20/30 ... see patches 1 and 2) that have gone unnoticed. So it
is a back compatibility issue.

If you are wondering why these interrupts break after "irqdomain: Don't
set type when mapping an IRQ", it is because today
irq_create_fwspec_mapping() does not check the return code from setting
the type, but if we defer setting the type until __setup_irq() which
does check the return code, then all of a sudden interrupts that were
working (even with bad configurations) start to fail.

The reason why I opted not to return an error code from
gic_configure_irq() is it really can't fail. The failure being reported
does not prevent the interrupt from working, but tells you your
configuration does not match the hardware setting which you cannot
overwrite.

So to maintain back compatibility and avoid any silent errors, I opted
to make it a WARN and not return an error.

If people are ok with potentially breaking interrupts for device-tree
binaries with bad settings, then I am ok to return an error here.

Cheers
Jon
