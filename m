Hmm, if I understand correctly what you say, this is exactly what this
particular series does:

regulator_get -> of_platform_device_ensure -> probe() on the platform
device that encloses the requested device node (i2c host) -> i2c slave
gets probed and the regulator registered -> regulator_get returns the
requested resource

The downside I'm currently looking at is that an explicit dependency
graph would be useful to have for other purposes. For example to print
a neat warning when a dependency cannot be fulfilled. Or to refuse to
unbind a device which other devices depend on, or to automatically
unbind the devices that depend on it, or to print a warning if a
device is hotplugged off and other devices depend on it.

Yeah, if you can give it a second look and say if it matches what you
wrote above, it would be very much appreciated.
