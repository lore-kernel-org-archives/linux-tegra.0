It seems like that's a soluble problem though?

I was thinking about adding a to_gpio function to struct irq_chip, as
the inverse of struct gpio_chip's to_irq. Then, presumably any platform
would be able to convert back from IRQ to GPIO, provided the platform
called a new __irq_to_gpio from the platform-specific gpio_to_irq, just
like most gpio_to_irq implementations defer to __gpio_to_irq.

I ended up not doing that in this patchset, since Tegra's gpio_to_irq
function already works for the IRQs/GPIOs that were relevant for my
testing, and I wanted to post a simple patch first to driver discussion.
