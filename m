We were talking about the original idea behind the pm_domain pointer
concept, which was about adding a set of PM operations above the bus
type/class layer, which could be used for intercepting bus-type PM
operations and providing some common handling above them.  This is
still relevant IMO.

The basic observation here is that the PM core takes only one set of
PM operation per device into account and therefore, in every stage of
system suspend, for example, the callback invoked by it has to take
care of all actions that need to be carried out for the given device,
possibly by invoking callbacks from other code layers.  That
limitation cannot be removed easily, because it is built into the PM
core design quite fundamentally.

However, this series seems to be about controlling power resources
represented by power domain objects rather than about PM operations.
In ACPI there is a power resource concept which seems to be quite
similar to this, so it is not entirely new. :-)

Of course, question is whether or not to extend genpd this way and I'm
not really sure.  I actually probably wouldn't do that, because
poweron/poweroff operations used by genpd can be implemeted in terms
of lower-level power resource control and I don't see the reason for
mixing the two in one framework.

No, it couldn't.  At least not in general.
