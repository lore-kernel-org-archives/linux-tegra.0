Even if it is possible it will be difficult for many reasons.

On the other side, current design (firmware) doesn't expect kernel
driver to have control over venus_core0 and venus_core1 pm domains. The
firmware manages those two pm domains internally and the only thing
which we need to do is to prepare those domains (and follow the power up
sequence) to be in hardware control mode. So I think the best we could
do is to model those two power domains as genpd subdomains of the parent
venus pm domain.
