This is a bad description.  It tells us what the patch is doing,
(which we can see by reading the patch) but not _why_.  Please include
information on why the change is necessary - describe what you are
trying to achieve.

I generally don't accept patches what add new stuff to the kernel with
no users of that new stuff - that's called experience, experience of
people who submit stuff like that, and then vanish leaving their junk
in the kernel without any users.  Please ensure that this gets a user
very quickly, or better still, submit this patch as part of a series
which makes use of it.

Also, copying soo many people is guaranteed to be silently dropped by
mailing lists.
