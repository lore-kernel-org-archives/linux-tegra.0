It is generic, though there are plenty of additional manufacturer/devic=
e
pairs that could go on top of it. m25p80 was (one of?) the first
supported, so the naming has been based on legacy, and we're in the
process of unwinding a bit of that. If it helps, we could move the doc
to .../mtd/spi-nor,nor-jedec.txt or something like that.

It's definitely for SPI only. There was much discussion about this a
few months back. Somewhere along the way, it was mentioned that the
context (SPI slave is a child of SPI master) would make this clear. I'm
still not sure why we didn't end up with something more descriptive,
though, like "spi-nor,nor-jedec".

I'm open to change, as this binding is new in 4.1-rc1.
