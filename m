I've reworded the commit message to give a more accurate rationale for
the change. I'll be posting a v5 soon.

This is useful to support the case where we want to connect a x1 or x2
device to a root port that is configured to drive more lanes. It's a
rather unusual configuration, but it would be possible for example to
have an onboard x1 ethernet card, but the board layout is such that it
runs in x1/x2 mode, with the ethernet card connected to the x2 port.

I've annotated these properties with "for Tegra124 and later", hopefully
that clarifies that these properties are only valid on Tegra124 and
later chips. The reason is that earlier (Tegra114 didn't support PCIe,
Tegra30 and Tegra20 did but had PHY registers within the PCI host bridge
I/O memory).
