just fwiw, but when you have a driver that depends on several other
drivers (which in turn depend on other drivers and so on), the amount
of probe-defer we end up seeing is pretty comical.  Yeah, there
probably is some room to optimize by juggling around order drivers do
things in probe.  But that doesn't solve the fundamental problem with
the current state, about probe order having no clue about
dependencies..
