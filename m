That's exactly what I was proposing in the first place. I did the same
thing in my patches for late interrupt reference resolution. The reason
why I think it makes sense to put it into the core is that it's
something that likely most devices will have to do anyway. And it also
is completely transparent to drivers, right? If they aren't attached to
an IOMMU then they just aren't but will continue to work properly. And
as you said, having it in the core makes drivers simpler, while at the
same time keeping the explicitness of having a function call (rather
than a somewhat obfuscated bus notifier) and the flexibility of deferred
probing.
