yes, you are right - it's left to user to break its board. I somehow missed 
this.

I don't want to drive this thread further off topic. I just like to add that 
the AC100 support is purly community driven. It is planed that we can use both 
bootloaders (fastboot and u-boot) with a 3.1 kernel (downstream nvidia based). 
In this situation, the user can upgrade his bootloader to u-boot and later 
install a 3.8 kernel based on mainline. At 3.10 kernel version times, all 
users are expected to have u-boot installed, whatever u-boot version is 
required then.
