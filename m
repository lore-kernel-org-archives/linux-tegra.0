I have come to a similar case with multiple power domains on Qualcomm APQ8096 - the
camera subsystem has two VFE modules (Video Front End - these are image processing modules)
and each of them has a separate power domain but we might want to control these from
a single driver.

So I wanted to ask if there have been any news on this topic lately?

Thank you.
Best regards,
Todor
