Ah, so you're looking for tegra20.dtsi to define the set pin groups that
can be configured, and tegra-harmony.dts to provide the configuration for
each of those pingroups.

As you see from my patches, I had assumed that the Tegra pinmux driver
would be what ended up defining the available pin groups, the register
addresses and fields for those groups, just like it does today. The DT
would only provide the configuration for each group. That's the reason
I didn't understand your questions the first time around.

So yes, I think we could represent the set of available pin groups in
tegra20.dtsi; it's just some data tables. I don't think this provides as
much benefit as moving the per-board configuration data into DT though,
because it changes only per SoC generation, not per board.

Still, putting the list of pingroups in tegra20.dtsi does move that data
out of the kernel, although it bloats each DTB with almost static data
that'll take a bunch of time to parse. It's worth considering though.

I'm unclear how to resolve where the best location for the data is though;
should we just go ahead and move it from the pinmux driver to DT right now,
or discuss more or ...?
