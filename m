Added support for dynamic clock freq configuration in pwm kernel driver.
Earlier the pwm driver used to cache boot time clock rate by pwm clock
parent during probe. Hence dynamically changing pwm frequency was not
possible for all the possible ranges. With this change, dynamic calculation
is enabled and it is able to set the requested period from sysfs knob
provided the value is supported by clock source.

Changes mainly have 2 parts:
  - T186 and later chips [1]
  - T210 and prior chips [2]

For [1] - Changes implemented to set pwm period dynamically and
          also checks added to allow only if requested period(ns) is
          below or equals to higher range.

For [2] - Only checks if the requested period(ns) is below or equals
          to higher range defined by max clock limit. The limitation
          in T210 or prior chips are due to the reason of having only
          one pwm-controller supporting multiple channels. But later
          chips have multiple pwm controller instances each having
	  single channel support.
