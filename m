All of them does not mean the same thing. The LP1 resume code was built
in kernel image and store in RAM.
The tegra_lp1_iram hooks the LP1 resume code for different chips. Before
LP1 suspend, the original stuffs that in the area of IRAM would be store
in the iram_save_addr (RAM). Then copy the LP1 resume code to iram_code
area (IRAM).

I will add some code that wraps to different SoC later. We add some
common code for LP1 support here, but it didn't support by the chip yet.
Does that OK or should I move it to the next patch?

That's why we only back up the code size that exactly same with the LP1
resume code of the SoC.

The LP1 resume code still running on the CPU (The LP0 would resume from
AVP).

OK. Will do.

Will fix.
