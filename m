The current downstream driver is incorrect for that case. We should be
updating it (at least, I filed a bug to do this).

Here's how the HW works (I believe this information should be in some
future version of the TRM):

There are 3 address spaces:

* The CPU bus.

* An internal (to the PCIe controller) 40-bit address space.
Apparently the layout is HyperTransport-based. Whether HT defines
this, or whether our HW engineers are referring to our particular
implementation of HT, I'm not sure.

* The PCIe external bus.

Accesses from the CPU to the PCIe controller's 1GB aperture are mapped
into the 40-bit bus using the BAR configurations in the PCIe
controller; I believe this is what tegra_pcie_setup_translations() is
configuring in our downstream driver.

Accesses are then mapped from this 40-bit bus to the external 32-bit
bus, I believe using a hard-coded mapping, which I believe may be
inherited from (our implementation of?) HyperTransport

For config and extended config accesses the mapping from the internal
to external bus is as follows:

In the case of PCICFG space,
addr[39:28]=12'hFDF,
addr[27:24]=4'hE means type 0 and addr[27:24]=4'hF means type 1,
addr[23:16]=bus number
addr[15:11]=device number
addr[10:8]=function number
addr[7:0]=register number

In the case of EXTCFG space,
addr[39:32]=8'hFE,
addr[31:28]=4'h0 means type 0 and addr[31:28]=4'h1 means type 1,
addr[27:24]=upper register number (i.e. register number[11:8])
addr[23:16]=bus number
addr[15:11]=device number
addr[10:8]=function number
addr[7:0]=register number (i.e. register number[7:0])

(in actual fact, the HW matches the top 16 or 12 bits to determine
config/ext-config and transaction type, so the top two fields in the
lists above should really be considered merged)

I hope this helps!
