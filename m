I wasn't really thinking of creating a whole new driver for the bus; the
existing simple-bus will automatically enumerate/instantiate all its
children, and hence allow describing (at least part of) the SoC bus
structure without writing any additional code. This appears to be used
quite a bit already in arch/arm/boot/dts/*.

I don't know.
