These actually seem to be a little bogus. The reason for introducing the
levels was to allow calibration of these values because they in fact
usually do not scale linearly. Instead, a linear brightness increase
usually maps to something like a logarithmic (at best) increase of the
duty cycle.

I actually like that a lot. What's missing from your example is a way to
specify the type of the phandle because it cannot be safely inferred.
Perhaps this could be done by just the property name:

	power_on_sequence {
		step@0 {
			power-supply =3D <&backlight_reg>;
			enable =3D <1>;
			post-delay =3D <10>;
		};
		step@1 {
			pwm =3D <&pwm 2 5000000>;
		};
		step@2 {
			enable-gpios =3D <&gpio 28 0>;
			enable =3D <1>;
		};
	};

However I think one of the reasons for Alex to choose his particular
representation is that people want this to be representable in the
platform data as well, which unfortunately can't deal very well with
this kind of situation.

Usually in the kernel you have one API to obtain a resource (pwm_get(),
regulator_get(), ...) which takes as an argument a device handle and a
name. For device tree, that API will lookup the resource by phandle,
while the non-DT code path typically uses a static lookup table.

It's a shame that we have to keep this kind of backwards compatibility
because it prevents these things from being represented in a logic way
in the DT sense.
