If you need to make your driver update the values reported via
PCI_L1SS_CAP, that makes sense.  I would guess it might depend on the
hardware implementation, though, so maybe it should be encoded in DT?

Yes.  I think we should do something like the patch below.

I am still curious about this because I *think* none of this will make
any difference unless firmware is enabling LTR.  Does firmware enable
LTR in your system?  I do think we should also make Linux enable LTR
when appropriate; I'm just wondering why people are tripping over the
LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD thing.

commit 8390e9bb6a809bb2201ffd29f2a37af6170b1606
Author: Bjorn Helgaas <bhelgaas-hpIqsD4AKlfQT0dZR+AlfA@public.gmane.org>

    PCI/ASPM: Calculate LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD from device characteristics
    
    Per PCIe r3.1, sec 5.5.1, LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD determines whether we enter
    the L1.2 Link state when CLKREQ# is de-asserted: if L1.2 is enabled and
    downstream devices have reported via LTR that they can tolerate latency of
    at least LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD, we must enter L1.2.  The implication is that
    LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD is the time required to transition the Link from L0 to
    L1.2 and back to L0.
    
    Previously we set LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD to a fixed value of 163840ns
    (163.84us), but that doesn't account for the because the L1.2 entry and
    exit times depend on the devices on both ends of the Link.
    
    We already set Common_Mode_Restore_Time and T_POWER_ON on both ends of the
    Link to the higher of the values reported in the L1 PM Substates
    Capabilities of the Link ends.  Use those to compute LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD:
    
        2us T(POWER_OFF)
      + 4us T(L1.2)
      + T(POWER_ON)
      + T(COMMONMODE)
      = LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD
    
    Note that while firmware may enable LTR, Linux itself currently does not
    enable LTR.  When L1.2 is enabled but LTR is not, LTR_L1.2_THRESHOLD is
    ignored and we always enter L1.2 when it is enabled and CLKREQ# is
    de-asserted.
