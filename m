Sure it is. Since the board files select which UARTs use the low-speed
driver vs. the high-speed driver by overriding the compatible value,
each board will have a different subset of UARTs which use the high
speed driver and hence which use the aliases. Don't you want to end up
with /dev/ttyHS0 on each board, rather than ending up with a "random"
device node name depending on which UART the board designer picked for
the high speed device?
