I took a closer look at the code to try and figure out a way to solve
this...

First of all, disable_nonboot_cpus *does* actually wait for the secondaries
to get out of the way, because it calls __cpu_die and we end up waiting on a
completion. The problem is that we IPI the secondaries in smp_send_stop,
which puts then into a while(1) cpu_relax(); loop with interrupts disabled,
so that completion won't be able to finish (the cores won't pass through
idle and call cpu_die() themselves).

This means we must call disable_nonboot_cpus before sending the IPI. My
first attempt was to make a hotplug-aware smp_send_stop, using
disable_nonboot_cpus and smp_kill_cpus but this is also problematic because
it's called by panic, where the simpler IPI-based code is probably a lot
better.

The best bet is probably to call disable_nonboot_cpus in machine shutdown,
before sending the stop and subsequent kill. It's very similar to your
initial suggestion, but without the #elif.

Does that work for you?
