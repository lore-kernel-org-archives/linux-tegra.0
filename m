Hmm, going back to the original post for this thread.

This more or less sounds very similar as the case for when Rajendra
described the problem for the video decode block in msm8996, except
that in this case you already have couple of different struct devices
available that for you could deploy runtime PM.

Then, wouldn't it be possible to assign a parent/child relationship
for these devices, each device has its own corresponding PM domain -
instead of having to dynamically nest PM domains.

Runtime PM will help to make sure parent devices are always active
when child devices also are active.

Again, if it's possible to model the topology by using parent/child
devices, and deploy runtime PM for them, then we shouldn't need more
than one PM domain per device. I am not sure that works here though,
but just and idea.

Kind regards
