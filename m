It would have been convenient if this patch had also added an include above:

#include <dt-bindings/interconnect/qcom,sdm845.h>

...while the include isn't technically needed by this patch, all the
patches that want to actually _use_ the interconnect will need to add
the #include and then you get to some fun fights about who has to add
the include in which patch.  For instance these two patches won't
compile:

* https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1545373748-1416-1-git-send-email-jshekhar@codeaurora.org
* https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20181220173026.3857-4-jcrouse@codeaurora.org

...because neither of them happened to add the include.  Maybe they
were both assuming someone else would do it?


If nobody else wants to, I'm happy to post a patch to add that include
myself and it can be applied atop this one.  ...or if this patch needs
to spin for some other reason maybe you could add it into this patch
directly?
