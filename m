I think the best solution to this problem consists in /me adding a
function, say, arm_dt_nb_cores(), that returns an error if DT probing
failed and the number of cores if it succeeded.

If it fails, you can fall back to SCU detection of cores for legacy
reasons (A9), but from A15 onwards I have quite a strong feeling against
using L2 as number of cores detection mechanism since it does not work
for multi-cluster systems. Fair enough, on Tegra this is not a problem
(now) but I do not want this method to propagate to other platforms where
multi-cluster number of cores detection will fail if we rely on the L2
mechanism.

This means that if the DT /cpu nodes are updated for all Tegra
platforms, DT becomes the mechanism to detect the number of cores
for all of them.

If you allow the A9 SCU mechanism to override the DT information (even
if it is correct) we might end up in the rather unwieldy situation where
there is a disconnect between the cpu_logical_map initialized entries and
the HW probed number of cores (if the DT bindings are correct the
cpu_logical_map entries are initialized by DT).

The gist is:

- if DT /cpu nodes are there and defined properly, we build the
  cpu_logical_map and count the number of cores from DT
- if DT /cpu nodes are missing or bogus we rely on the cpu_logical_map
  in smp_setup_processor_id() and fall back to legacy mechanism to detect
  the number of cores. This just for legacy boards/SoC.

Let me know if this is reasonable please.

You can probe the number of cores through SCU but remember
that MPIDRs of existing CPUs are generated, not probed if the DT is not
present (smp_setup_processor_id()). cpu_logical_map content, before the
DT bindings were introduced, or even now if DT /cpu nodes are bogus, is
simply generated as a sequential number but is not *probeable* per-se.
To tell the truth, this works well for all existing ARM platforms in the
mainline but moving forward we'd better stick at bits of information provided
by the DT, at least that's my opinion.

Thoughts ?
