The legacy config access mechanism (CF8h/CFCh registers described in
PCI 3.0 spec sec 3.2.2.3.2) is a single address/data pair, but this is
mostly x86-specific.  The ECAM mechanism (described in the PCIe 3.0
spec sec 7.2.2) is not a single address/data pair; instead, each byte
of config space is directly mapped into the host's MMIO space.

Here's what we do on x86 (omitting some historical grunge that
complicates things):

  - Discover the host bridge via a PNP0A08 device in the ACPI namespace.
  - Discover the bus number range behind the bridge using a _CRS
method in the PNP0A08 device.
  - Discover the ECAM space for those buses via a _CBA method in the
PNP0A08 device.
  - Tell the config accessors (struct pci_ops) that the ECAM space for
buses A-B is at address X.
  - Enumerate the devices behind the host bridge by calling
pci_scan_root_bus(), passing the config accessors.

It sounds like you want a way to parse the resources at one point,
saving them and marking the ECAM region, then at a later point, look
up the ECAM from a saved list.  We don't do that on x86 because the
config accessors keep an internal list of the ECAM area for each bus.

We do of course want to put this ECAM space in the IORESOURCE_MEM tree
because it consumes address space and we have to make sure we don't
put anything else on top of it.  But we don't have any reason to
describe the MMIO -> config space function in that tree.  From the
point of view of the rest of the system, it's just MMIO space that's
consumed by the PCI host bridge, just like any other device-specific
MMIO area.
