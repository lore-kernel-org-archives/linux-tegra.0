Well, it's supposed to be abstract. From the CDF point of view it could 
be anything besides a panel. I know this makes it an output of an 
output, but I can't think of anything better right now.

Oh, this was supposed to be called on output->output actually, to 
balance the display_entity_get() of the connect event. Thanks for 
catching this.

Yes, that's absolutely right.

Nope. AFAICT the device might not be instanciated at this point. We 
become aware of it for the first time in the callback function. We also 
don't want to defer probing until the panel is parsed first, since the 
panel might also depend on resources of the display device.

Thanks,
Alex.
