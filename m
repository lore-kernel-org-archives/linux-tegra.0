I managed to find CDEV clocks in TRM this time. Seems assigning CDEV2 clock to
"ulpi-link" was correct and both CDEV2 and PLL_P_OUT4 should be enabled, CDEV2
should gate the PLL_P_OUT4 that feeds USB HW and PLL_P_OUT4 should be
always-enabled because it is enabled by init_table, but apparently it is getting
disabled erroneously.

Marcel, could you please revert your patch, add
"trace_event=clk_enable,clk_disable,clk_set_parent tp_printk" to kernels cmdline
and post the log?

It looks like there is some clk framework bug, but just in case please also try
to apply this patch:
