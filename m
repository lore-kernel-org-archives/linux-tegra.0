IIRC, even changing the EMC clock rate requires modifying the memory
controller's programming (e.g. delays/taps/tuning etc.). That's exactly
what the more complex stuff in the nvidia,tegra20-emc.txt is all about.
I not convinced that a driver that just modifies the clock rate without
adjusting the EMC programming will work reliably.

My comments remain the same. I believe this is something that belongs in
the clock driver, or at the least, some API that takes a struct clock as
its parameter, so that drivers can use the existing DT clock lookup
mechanism.
