A quick note on the way that Tegra's devicetree files are broken up in
Grant's devicetree/test branch:

* There's "tegra250.dtsi" which defines everything on the Tegra SoC
  itself.
* There's a per-board e.g. harmony.dts which includes tegra250.dtsi,
  And additionally:
  ** Defines all devices on the board
  ** Hence, defines the usage of e.g. all the Tegra GPIOs for the
     board.

I like this model, because it shares the complete definition of the
Tegra SoC in a single file, rather than duplicating it with cut/paste
into every board file.

As such, the code quoted above would be in tegra250.dtsi.

This has two relevant implications here:

1) The names "gpio1" and "gpio2" would be driven by the Tegra SoC's
naming of those GPIO pins, and not any board-specific naming, e.g.
"tegra_gpio_px1", "tegra_gpio_pb5". Equally, the usage comment would
be at the client/reference site, not the GPIO definition site.

2) The GPIO mode should be defined by the client/user of the GPIO, not
the SoC's definition of that GPIO.

Without those two conditions, we couldn't share anything through
tegra250.dtsi.

Re-iteration of these implications below.

I'd expect address cells only if referencing a gpio-controller; if
referencing a gpio device node, the address would be implicit.

Yes, I agree. Although, I think your (3) is inconsistent with the gpio
controller definitions you wrote above, which include the mode
definitions in the controller instead of the user.

Just re-iterating: I'd prefer mode to be solely in the reference, and
not in the gpio controller.

Does this SoC/board segregation make sense to everyone? Obviously it
does to me:-)
