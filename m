If we go this way (which looks good IMO!), then maybe we should abandon 
that "platform" denomination and merge platform_power_seq* structures 
with the currently private power_seq*, and also replace the "building" 
step with a resources acquisition one. Calling these structures 
"platform" implies they are for platform data while they can be used to 
perform more flexible things as Mark mentioned. Also making the resolved 
resource visible would allow drivers to "patch" generic sequences with 
the proper GPIO numbers at runtime. We would also avoid a few memory 
copies and both design and usage would be simplified, at the cost of 
having more things exposed. How does that sound?

Alex.
