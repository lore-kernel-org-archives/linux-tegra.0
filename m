I'm honestly not sure if it is ready yet.

New versions are coming on and on, which may make such an impression,
but we had some discussion on it at the LPC and some serious questions
were asked during it, for instance regarding the DT binding introduced
here.  I'm not sure how this particular issue has been addressed here,
for example.
