Peter,

Is this reparent permanent (as in, stays reparented when you return from 
clk_set_rate()) or is it a reparenting for just a short duration inside 
the set_rate ops?

If it's the latter, I don't think you would need any helper code in 
clock framework other than the already existing __clk_prepare() and 
clk_enable(). Just turn on the temp parent, reparent to it, do whatever 
you need to do, and go back to your original parent.

If it's the former (permanent reparent), can I assume that the 
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag won't be set for this clock? Otherwise, it's 
going to be quite yucky/convoluted. I'm not sure how well a reparent 
would work with the code in common clock framwework that walks up the 
parents to propagate the rate change to them. I wouldn't say that it's 
wrong to only want to propagate the rate for certain rates and for 
certain parents, but I will have to stare at the common clock code for a 
while.

Mike,

I was looking at the code to make the changes and I noticed this snippet 
(reformatted for email) in clk_change_rate():

        if (clk->ops->set_rate)
                 clk->ops->set_rate(clk->hw, clk->new_rate,
					clk->parent->rate);


         if (clk->ops->recalc_rate)
                 clk->rate = clk->ops->recalc_rate(clk->hw,
                                 clk->parent->rate);
         else
                 clk->rate = clk->parent->rate;

I'm a bit confused. I thought recalc_rates was optional. But if I don't 
implement it, the clocks rate will get set to parent's rate? Or is that 
a bug in the code?

Also, if the clock's rate was just set with set_rate, why do we need to 
recalc the rate by reading hardware? I'm a bit confused. Can you please 
clarify what's going on here?

Would you mind adding more comments inside clk_calc_new_rates() and 
clk_change_rate() trying to explain what cases you are trying to account 
for?

Also, in clk_calc_new_rates(),

         if (!clk->ops->round_rate) {
                 top = clk_calc_new_rates(clk->parent, rate);
                 new_rate = clk->parent->new_rate;

                 goto out;
         }

Is the code assuming that if there is no round rate ops that that clock 
node is only a gating clock (as in, can't change frequency the input 
freq)? Just trying to understand the assumptions made in the code.

Thanks,
Saravana
