Yeah, this is pretty much what MSM has been doing for a while for our 
CPU clocks too. But in MSM we made the decision of not to control the 
CPU clocks through the clock APIs. It makes your life so much more 
easier. Really, the CPU clocks are very different from the rest of the 
clocks -- the set rate operation of the clock needs the clock to be 
running. We also never disable the CPU clock we are running on. Just 
that it might not be as useful as it might appear. It was especially 
hard when we didn't have clk_prepare/_unprepare().

Anyway, not saying this is the only way to proceed or using the clock 
APIs to control the CPU clock is wrong. Just some food for thought.

Anyway, getting back to the point of this thread, you might look at the 
other email I sent out on Friday [1]. Sorry I forgot to cc you on that. 
I have a list of people I copy paste when sending clock patches. I can 
add you to that list if you want (or remove anyone who is annoyed by it).

If you are doing the parent management inside the .set_rate ops, I 
believe you will have a race condition with the current clock framework. 
We need to update the clock framework to provide more APIs to implement 
this correctly. I was confused by some code and pinged Mike about it. 
Now that I understand what the code was trying to do, I think I might be 
able to clean it up a bit and then fix up set rate support.

Thanks,
Saravana
