Ok, as per our internal discussion, I am going to drop first three 
patches. I will relookinto these patches once your series get applied 
and will work if there is any missing items.


Stephen,
I will respin the 4th patch based on how the discussion on serial driver 
goes. I will send the new patch for 4th change.
