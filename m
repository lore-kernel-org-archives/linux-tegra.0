I was thinking that maybe each port should be represented as a child node,
but I'm not sure that's going to work too well because the children of the
pci node are supposed to be PCI busses/devices. I'll have to check whether
they could just as well be children of the PCIe port nodes.

That way each port could get an own set of register ranges to better descri=
be
the actual layout. AFAICT the even partitioning of the non-prefetchable and
prefetchable memory regions is arbitrary and it could potentially be useful
to make it configurable via the DT.

Unfortunately the PCIe controller is very badly documented in the TRM, so
this information is hard to locate (I guess the best source is one of the
downstream drivers).

Last time I looked they seemed to be simple enough to handle the differences
using OF compatible matches. I believe apart from the PCIe area changes the=
re
were some differences in how the MSI were setup.

Yes, we should at least try to get it right from the start.
