It's a revert of the patch which introduced max_discard_to, so all that
logic goes away completely, *then* the 3 lines above, which move the
timeout away from command submission (which is what I believe is
implemented by the controller's timeout HW) and to the CMD13 polling
operation (where we can implement whatever timeout we want, in the kernel).
