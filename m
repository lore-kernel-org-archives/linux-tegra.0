Could you provide a practical example that answers my question above:

"why can't the governor execute the code before polling started, does
it make any difference to the governor that a work is scheduled?"

yes, I noticed that too, it can be easily fixed with a flag in the
governor.

As per above, the governor could have a flag indicating that it
doesn't need load monitoring.

I think it should be avoided to expect the governors to do the right
thing if certain actions are mandatory and common for all governors
(unless the feature in question is not used). It should be handled in
the core code, unless there are good reasons not to do this.

With thispatch set the amount of code remains essentially the same,
and no new code needs to be added for governors that don't do anything
special in start/stop/suspend/resume.

TBH I think probably the entire event handler multiplexing should go
away and be changed to a struct devfreq_ops with optional callbacks
for start, stop, suspend, resume and update interval. As far as I can
tell the multiplexing isn't needed and separate ops would result in
cleaner code, in both the devfreq core and the governors.

Cheers
