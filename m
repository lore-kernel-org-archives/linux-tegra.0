I personally like the watermark naming and think it is a pretty good
analogy to what this series is doing, but your call.

Considering that watermarking is a pretty common technique for the
kind of work that devfreq is attempting to cover (implementing
event-driven frequency scaling vs. polling-driven as current devfreq
does), doesn't it make sense to turn it into a core devfreq feature? I
don't think devfreq can be that easily extended and doing so might
make things messier than they are.

Indeed. Watermarking support would make the ACTMON driver simpler and
easier to integrate with all the governors that devfreq currently has.
Without core support for it, it could only interact properly with its
own, dedicated governor.

MyungJoo, the issue of having this feature in the core vs. having it
as a devfreq "extension" aside, do you agree with the core idea? An
informl ack for the idea would allow us to start leveraging this for
the ACTMON driver. With a concrete user it will make it easier for
everyone to understand how the pieces should fit together.
