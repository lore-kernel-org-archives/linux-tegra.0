Sorry, that file was sent before I had finished removing the bits from 
downstream that aren't needed yet. There's no current need for any child 
nodes.

There's even less stuff needed right now, as all what ultimately the EMC 
driver does is call clk_set_rate on the EMC clock. As the T124 EMC 
driver gains more features, they should get more similar.

Not really needed, see above.

Sounds better indeed, thanks.

Yes, I wrote a bit in the cover letter about our requirements and how 
they map to the CCF. Could you please comment on that?

Thanks,
