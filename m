I moved it out of the Tegra PCIe driver on your request. Also I can
already see this being useful for the Keystone PCI host driver to
shorten the MTRS quirk function.

I will rename this to pcie_find_root_port() so it is clear that this is
PCIe specific, but keep it in the current location.

Right, will change this.
