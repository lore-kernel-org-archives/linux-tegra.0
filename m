It's supposed to be done at probe() time. But sdhci_setup_host()
does both 32-bit/64-bit dma_mask setting and dma_alloc(), so if
the dma_mask isn't correctly set inside sdhci_setup_host(), the
allocation would fall to a 64-bit IOVA range that hardware does
not support -- smmu error would happen and crash the system. On
the other hand, ->enable_dma() is called in that function right
after 32-bit/64-bit dma_mask setting. Or is there any other way
of adding to probe() that I am missing here?

Thanks
