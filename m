Do you agree that this will likely not be a problem with a more or less
stupid framebuffer DRM driver? I recall you mention that in a 3D context
where the scattered buffers are for example geometry provided by OpenGL,
right?

I think we need to put some thoughts into that once we start to
implement more advanced features. At that point we may also want to
think about how to integrate that with TTM.

Okay, this pretty much matches what we've agreed on in another
subthread. CMA looks like the best option for now as it should
cover everything we need at present.
