In the example, the sequence (including delays) is clearly stated by the 
backlight specification, which is part of the panel specification. The backlight 
uses a PWM, which makes it suitable to use the generic PWM backlight driver, 
but how to turn the backlight on and off is very backlight specific. The power 
sequences allow to replace the board-specific backlight callbacks by sequences 
in the DT.

On the other hand, I saw your discussion with Laurent about the panel 
framework, and I wonder how this would fit into it. Backlights are typically 
embedded within panels. Power sequences are a good way to deal with the 
absence of specific drivers for every panels, since they allow to tailor the 
behavior of generic drivers to fit particular needs. But if every panel comes 
with its own driver (which would define the backlight device using the most 
appropriate driver), then it could just as well perform its backlight's 
sequences via regular callbacks. In this particular case, there would be no 
need for power sequences.

Power sequences are supposed to go beyond backlight drivers and support all 
sort of devices (I have heard that it could be useful for modems as well), but 
I wonder how relevant they are when there is a proper driver for a device. I 
hate to question my own work but now I cannot help but think that a proper 
driver could do the same job. So what are we trying to achieve with power 
sequences? Are we trying to avoid a drivers' explosion by keeping some of the 
specifics out of them? Which approach would be preferable? Are there cases 
where a dedicated driver could not replace power sequences?

Alex.
