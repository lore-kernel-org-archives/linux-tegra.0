Can we deprecate the Samsung format, and only allow it for that Samsung
device (and allow both there), and require a single format for any othe=
r
keyboard?

The issue here is that U-Boot wants to stay small, and having to allow
two alternative methods to specify a keyboard is going to bloat the cod=
e;
I expect some pushback adding DT support for just one binding by the ti=
me
they see all the DT parsing code that's needed to do it all right.
