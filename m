Yes, and for another reason: The entries in the reg property are
supposed to be within the bus address space that contains the device,
whereas here this 3rd reg entry is being used to define something about
an entirely unrelated address space - the virtual address space seen by
SMMU clients.

I agree, but:

Why do those pages even need special handling? Doesn't the AVP get its
own address space ID, and then can set it up however it wants?
