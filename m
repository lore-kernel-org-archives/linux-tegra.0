I've come around to your way of thinking. Your approach sounds good for
registration of MSI ops - let the RC host driver do it (it probably has its
own), or use a helper for following a phandle to get ops that are not part
of the driver. MSIs won't be used outside of PCI devices.

Though existing drivers will use MSI framework functions to request MSIs, that
will result in callbacks to the arch_setup_msi_irqs type functions. These
functions would need to be updated to find these new ops if they exist, i.e. by
traversing the pci_dev structure up to the RC and finding a suitable structure.

Perhaps the msi ops could live alongside pci_ops in the pci_bus structure. This
way when traversing up the buses from the provided pci_dev - the first bus with
msi ops populated would be used?

If no ops are found, the standard arch callbacks can be called - thus preserving
exiting functionality.
