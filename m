I haven't looked at the code in this patch since I'm mainly concerned 
about the DT bindings. However, I will say that nothing in the change to 
the mailbox specifier in DT should have required /any/ changes to the 
code, except to add a single check to validate that the "mailbox type" 
encoded into the top 16 bits of the mailbox ID were 0, and hence 
represented a doorbell rather than anything else. Any enhancements to 
support other mailbox types could have happened later, and I doubt would 
require anything dynamic even then.

All resources provided by other devices/drivers must be acquired at 
probe time, since that's the only time it's possible to defer probe if 
the provider of the resource is not available.

If you don't follow that rule, what happens is:

1) This driver probes.

2) Some other driver calls tegra_hsp_db_init(), and it fails since the 
provider of the IRQ is not yet available. This likely ends up returning 
something other than -EPROBE_DEFER since the HSP driver was found 
successfully (thus there is no deferred probe situation as far as the 
mailbox core is concerned), it's just that the mailbox channel 
lookup/init/... failed.

3) The other driver's probe() fails due to this, but since the error 
wasn't a probe deferral, the other driver's probe() is never retried.
