Oh, the comparison against cpu_online_mask() is what I was missing. I
guess that offline CPUs don't go into LP2, so you can't just check that
tegra_cpu_lp2_mask == (1 << num_cpus()) - 1.

One way to avoid that might be to maintain a cpu_in_lp2_count variable
alongside the mask, and simply compare that against num_online_cpus()
rather than comparing the two masks. At least that would avoid the
following line:

>>> +	writel(tegra_in_lp2.bits[0], tegra_cpu_lp2_mask);

... making use of knowledge of the internal structure of the struct
cpumask type.

However, given the comparison requirement, either way is probably fine.
