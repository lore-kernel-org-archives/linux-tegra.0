Except that you don't need them for arm64 systems, becuase we don't yet
have that legacy for arm64...

So doing the wrong thing on a subset of boards is fine because it's not
all boards?

Imagine I make a typo in a DT for a 64-bit system, and suddnely hit
youre legacy code. Things happen to work, because I don't botehr reading
the splat in dmesg for whatever reason.

Later we do some cleanup of the existing legacy, for whatever reason,
and we get rid of this particular path for arm64.

Suddenly my board won't boot, and to fix that we have to reintroduce
legacy support code only because said legacy support was enabled where
it should never have been in the first place. Another OS trying to
target/use these DTBs has barely any chance of success.

No. I'm saying that the workarounds we have in place for legacy DTBs
should be constrained to those cases where legacy DTBs actually exist.
There is no reason for that legacy to carry across to 64-bit.

At the very least I think the soc_is_tegra stuff needs to be constrained
to fallback paths that can only possibly run on 32-bit.

Fair point. 

Thanks,
