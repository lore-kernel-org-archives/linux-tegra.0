The main thing I want to avoid is a ton of separate drivers that all
rely on each-other getting resolved by deferred probe. While that might
work out, it seems pointless to make the kernel try and probe a bunch of
stuff just to have it fail and get repeated, when we know exactly which
order everything should get initialized in.

Another issue is that we have SoCs which only differ in the CPU. I want
the code to work identically on both SoCs so the CPU has limited affect
on the low-level IO code. If we're going to enforce a "no machine
descriptors" rule on arch/arm64, I think we should do the same thing in
arch/arm for consistency.

I guess that would work out OK; if we force the driver that binds to a
top-level compatible value of "nvidia,tegraNNN" to probe first, and it
then calls out to all the low-level init code in a sane order, that
would solve the problem. I'm not sure that's any better than having a
machine descriptor with an "init" function though; wrapping all this in
a driver just seems like overhead, but it would work out OK.
