reg = <1> ?

ISTM that having two reg entries, specifying the rp and ctrl registers, 
is preferable to having code to calculate the addresses.  That makes the 
code simpler and the device tree more directly descriptive of the 
hardware layout.  The less "magic" (in this case, the register address 
calculation), the better.
