Converting GPIOs to IRQs is really useful. The reverse mapping is not as
easy, as when go NR->CHIP->to_irq() method, but the reverse is not being
tracked at the moment, which makes life difficult.

I would say that setting the interrupt should deal with all the necessary
configuration to get that interrupt working. In the case of pretty much all
of the SoCs I have been involved with have always set the GPIO's function
to allow the interrupt to pass through.

Whilst there's a case for having this being done either in the core IRQ
code (may break for everyone else) we could quite easily do this in the
GPIO driver.

As a note, we are actuallly trying to remove the irq_to_gpio() calls, as
they are not widely used across the kernel, very sparsely and badly
implemented across ARM and are very rarely used (the IIO system is the
only system currently doing this, for some fairly nasty reasons)
