Those look good.

I'm don't think having an explicit "drm" node is the right approach; drm
is after all a SW term and the DT should be describing HW. Having some
kind of top-level node almost certainly makes sense, but naming it
something related to "tegra display" than "drm" would be appropriate.

Aren't the outputs separate HW blocks too, such that they would have
their own compatible/reg properties and their own drivers, and be
outside the top-level drm/display node?

I believe the mapping between the output this node represents and the
display controller ("dc" above) that it uses is not static; the
connectivity should be set up at runtime, and possibly dynamically
alterable via xrandr or equivalent.

Drivers are expected to use pre-existing platform data, if provided.
This might happen in order to work around bugs in device tree content.
