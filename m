ACK.

ACK. Just curious, which register was it? I only checked that they
have the same count of registers.

ACK the nvidia,snor-config part, will though wait for further comments
regarding what to do with the config registers, break-out or keep it
is a one property / register.

Regarding mio-config, not sure about if I would like to include that
part in this stage. If you feel strongly about this we can do it. If
it only comes to down to replicate the same configurations that we do
for SNOR to MIO then I do not see much of a problem, but would like
SNOR to be accepted and would not like the MIO part to halt this. But
then again this up to you guys.

This is true. If we include MIO support above could be added to the bindings.

ACK.

Yes that is true. One has to modify the SNOR_CONFIG register to choose
a different CS pin.

I do not understand why CS pin setting in nvidia,config need to match
the "ranges" prop? Other then maybe cosmetics.

If we do not have any external decoding logic to create more
chip-selects we only have ONE chip-select, and that one should always
be indexed as 0? Regardless of which CS pin is used. Because
ultimately what we configure in SNOR_CONFIG is which PIN(function) to
use as chip-select. The address space remains the same.

Indeed it is. ACK.

Thank you Jonanthan for your feedback.
