We are not only check the cpu_in_lp2_mask here. The most important thing
here was to check all the other secondary CPUs were already been power
gated. We need to check the physical power status of the CPUs not
logical status.

When there are only 2 CPU online, the "num_online_cpus() > 1" would be
true and the "tegra_cpu_rail_off_ready" still would be checked.

Yes, indeed.

No, we need to make sure the CPU0 is the last one go into LP2 state and
all other CPUs already be power gated. This is the only safe way to shut
off vdd_cpu rail (HW limitation).

Yes, indeed. Actually, I had tried the coupled cpuidle on Tegra20. I
knew it a lot. But I met issues when porting it. It looks like a race
condition and becomes a dead lock caused by IPI missing. Anyway, we can
talk about it more detail when I try to upstream the coupled cpuidle
support for Tegra later.

Yes. If the coupled cpuidle could support the CPUs can randomly leave
the coupled state, it would be perfect.

OK. I will add the "pclk" clock interface for Tegra30.
