Yes, I want an option for debugging of a broken PM. It doesn't matter that there are no known PM-related issues on Tegra today, it could become a problem tomorrow. Probably a kernel boot parameter like pm_debug_always_on would suit even better here. 

Or maybe PM API already provides such debug options and I'm just not aware about them?

Do you know what's the exact reason for ARM64 to not support !PM?
