Thank you, that was not clear from reading this patch.

Are you saying that there's no actual devfreq'ing going on, we just
expose it through that framework in order to get the standardized
metrics out of sysfs?

Or that and to perform the initial configuration and start the memlat
logic? Does the firmware do memlat adjustments without this driver?

Please make sure that it's clear what role this driver has.

In line with our discussion above, please make sure that the help text
is helpful for someone to understand the purpose of the driver and help
them make that y/m/n decision.

Sounds good. I'm a bit puzzled about it being a devfreq driver, but if
you can explain the bigger picture, I think that will help to reason
about it.

Please move it into the c-file, move things around so that you have
clear segments of "definitions", "configuration", "logic", and "driver
boilerplate".

back_end_stall_percentage is a bit log (and I'm not entirely sure that
it is). Perhaps you can provide some kernel-doc and express what it is?

But are there not different SKUs of these SoCs which need different
tables? Information that we today would encode in e.g. OPP-tables in
DeviceTree.

While that's true for sampling in general, please make the comment
explain why it's true in this case.
