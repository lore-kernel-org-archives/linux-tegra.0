Hm, I was trying to keep the series bisectable. If we do that
after introducing the default state concept, then some drivers will
retrieve invalid values until the patches introducing the default
helpers and changing the different drivers to call the default helpers
where appropriate are introduced.

Yes, but we don't live in an ideal world ;-), and the value set in an
old bootloaders might be considered wrong at some point, and new dts
versions might decide to change a bit the period value.
