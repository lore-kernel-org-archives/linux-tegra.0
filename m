Yeah, that's where I was getting to with that test patch I posted.

Thanks for volunteering :)

That's a good idea, yes - a single enum much more reflects what we can
actually do in terms of transitions.

I think we need to either drop your change (which would be bad since it
is a big performance improvement, I'd punted it for later when I did the
original refactoring to push the work into the caller threads then never
got around to it) or have a invasive changes to make the new situation
clearer.  Right now things are just far too complex to reason about
which isn't helping anyone.
