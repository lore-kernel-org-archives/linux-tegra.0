well, I don't disagree that IOMMU API has some problems.  It is too
tied to the bus type, which doesn't really seem to make sense for
platform devices.  (Unless we start having multiple platform busses?)

But at least given the current IOMMU API I'm not really sure how it
makes a difference which way the link goes.  But if there has already
been some discussion about how you want to handle the tie in with
dma-mapping, if you could point me at that then maybe your point will
make more sense to me.

hmm, well if some of the things I need for (like this or batching
mappings) are too weird and gpu specific, I'm willing to duplicate the
IOMMU driver in drm/msm.  It really isn't so much code, and that gives
me a lot more more flexibility to do crazy things... at some point I'm
probably going to want to do context switches by banging the IOMMU
registers directly from the gpu.

But given what Will said, I don't think what I need here is too far
out of line.  But if it is really a problem for dma-mapping, I suppose
we could have links in both directions?  However, I think the link
which contains the stream-id's really needs to be in the IOMMU, not
the device using the IOMMU.
