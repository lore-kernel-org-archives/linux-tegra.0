I don't question the utility of TCU. I just wonder if mailbox api
should provide a backdoor for atomic busy-wait in order to support a
sub-optimal hw+fw design.

It is emulated/virtual because Linux doesn't put characters on a
physical bus. The data is simply handed forward to a remote entity.

The 'flush' api is going to have no use other than implement
busy-waits. I am afraid people are simply going to take it easy and
copy the busy-waits from the test/verification codes.
"discouraging" seldom works because the developer comes with the
failproof excuse "the h/w doesn't provide any other way". Frankly I
would like to push back on such designs.

 Anyways, let us add the new 'flush' api.

Thanks.
