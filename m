Hi,

This is a follow up to [0].

What's changed in v2:

  - The "Use ww_mutex for regulators locking" patch compiles now for the
    drivers that are touching "rdev's" mutex, in a result regulator_[un]lock()
    functions are public now.

  - Added new patch to the series ("Keep regulators-list locked while
    traversing the list") which further firms regulators locking.

  - Changed commit description of the "Change regulator-coupled-max-spread
    property" patch, saying that it's fine to change the binding because
    property doesn't have any users yet. That was requested by Rob Herring
    in the review comment to v1.

Dmitry Osipenko (3):
  regulator: core: Use ww_mutex for regulators locking
  regulator: core: Properly handle case where supply is the couple
  regulator: core: Keep regulators-list locked while traversing the list
