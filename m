I think they need to be listed here in order for the child nodes to be able
to map them using their ranges property. It's possible that it'll work by
specifying an empty ranges, but I don't think it'd be correct in the OF
sense.

I agree that maybe adding properties for each bit position or register offs=
et
may not work out too well. But I think it still makes sense to use the base
address of the port's registers (see below). We could of course add some co=
de
to determine the index from the base address at initialization time and reu=
se
the index where appropriate.

They're not identical. Port 0 gets the first half and port 1 gets the second
half of the ranges specified in the parent.

Yes, I believe that works with the code I have currently, which basically
parses the ranges property of each port and initializes the I/O, memory and
prefetchable regions from those values.

It's not so much the DT code, but rather the PCI core and ultimately the
device model that requires it. Each port is basically a PCI host bridge that
provides a root PCI bus and the device model is used to represent the
hierachy of the busses. Providing just the DT node isn't going to be enough.
