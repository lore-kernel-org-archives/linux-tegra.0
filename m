Sure dropping parts of that. I'll try to reify the package concept a bi=
t.
However since I have this nice chessboard example I have to say
what I'm talking about, the topology of this 2D PGA field is pretty fun=

No not at all. This is defining the terms.

Perfect fit with this pinmux API.

Perfect fit with this pinmux API.

Perfect fit with this pinmux API.

Perfect fit with this pinmux API. The Nomadik pinmux is basically the
same.

Note that the pinmux API makes sure you haven't used a single pin for
GPIO at the same time as you're using a group containing the same pin.

I am currently contemplating whether to include a control function for
this stuff in the pinmux API. I probably will, and then make sure the
enumerators match those I have just defined for GPIO (since there may
be systems with such settings for just GPIO pins (which cannot be
muxed) and vice versa for muxable pins that cannot be used for GPIO
but still driven low if unused for example.

Just pinmux_get()/pinmux_put()/pinmux_get()/pinmux_put() to switch
these functions in/out at runtime. (Described in reply to Russell
in patch 0.)

Thanks, leftover, removed it.

Yeah :-P thanks.

No not at all. Like in the case with the gpiolib, we may have several m=
uxes
on the system (e.g. in the U8500 we have alternate functions not only
on the SoC package but also on the AB8500 mixsig circuit). The offset
refers to the pin inside the pin range handled by that specific driver.

If you have only *one* pinmux driver on your system it will be the same
thing, but not in the general case.

Good catch, thanks!

My idea is that if a certain gpiolib driver may need to request a pin t=
hat
is muxed, it will translate the GPIO pin number into a pinmux pin and
call pinmux_request_gpio() on that pin. So in my head only gpiolib driv=
er
under drivers/gpio() would nominally be calling this to reserve pins.

Since not all GPIOs are muxable, it'll need to be on a per-driver basis=

Yes and that is possible with pinmux_get() too, you can specify
a function not tied to a particular device.

It's relevant.

Thanks a lot Stephen! Once/if you like the API, please ACK it.
