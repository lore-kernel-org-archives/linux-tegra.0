Is it an error condition if no clocks were present in DT, or if no clocks have
been accepted by the filter function? If not, the caller has to check for
-ENODEV. Now the caller has to call pm_clk_create() first, before it knows if
any clocks will be added, it may want to call pm_clk_destroy() later if no
clocks have been added.

Alternatively, you could return 0 vs. the actual number of clocks added.

I hooked up your code in renesas-cpg-mssr.c, and it worked.
However, I noticed it added 27 clocks for one device node (rcar_sound), and
only then I realized that I only want to add the first clock accepted by the
filter, not all of them, as the others are under driver control.
I'm not sure this can be handled in the filter function.
So I can't use your code (for now)...

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
