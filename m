Sounds to me like something that should be opt-in. Given that we could
potentially map a lot of memory, the additional read seems like it could
incur a significant performance penalty.

How about protecting this by some Kconfig symbol (or debug module
parameter) and adding a WARN instead of failing the mapping operation?

The reason is that we really should be using the GART from a single
driver because it is a shared memory region. To avoid drivers from
treading on each others' feet the allocations must be managed by some
central entity. So either something like DMA API should manage it, or
we hardwire it to Tegra DRM explicitly.

And if a central allocator is responsible for all mappings through the
GART, then we should assume that it isn't buggy, and therefore the extra
check of the PTEs should not be needed in most cases, hence we can get a
performance boost by disabling the check by default.

Of course if there is not much performance impact, maybe it is okay to
keep it always enabled.
