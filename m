That argument seems a bit inconsistent.

I can see the argument to disallow code that lets user-space fiddle with 
clocks. However, if that argument holds, then surely it must apply to 
either the clock core *or* a clock driver; the end effect of allowing 
the code in either place is that people will be able to implement the 
user-space hacks you want to avoid. Yet, if we allow the code because 
it's a useful debug tool, then surely it should be in the clock core so 
we don't implement it redundantly in each clock driver.

We could always taint the kernel if the feature is used. Admittedly that 
wouldn't stop people using the feature as a hack in Android/product 
kernels, but at least nobody would have to unknowingly debug problems 
due to such manipulation, in the context of an upstream kernel.
