FWIW, I have the feeling this has a slight influence on boot reliability on
two of my boards:
  - r8a7740/armadillo, which is known to suffer from a cache-related bug in
    its bootloader, seems to have a higher change of booting successfully on
    cold boot,
  - sh73a0/kzm9g, which has known cache-issues with secondary CPU boot up,
    seems to have a lower chance of booting successfully.

No time to spend all week turning this into a statistical significant test
project... The reset button is my friend...
