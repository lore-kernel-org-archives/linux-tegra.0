But alas, there are no PM domains with CONFIG_PM unset.

CONFIG_PM unset means that the *driver* has to know how to turn on the
device and that has to be sufficient.

Which basically is my point when I'm saying that this information is
not available to the core and it cannot do anything to handle this
case without the extra knowledge.
