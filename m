Yes, this 0day build system rocks. It will pull in specific branches
in maintainer branch and do building/automatic code checking like
smack/boot testing. If they find any issues, they will send out emails
directly to the authors and SoB persons. We just need to add our ARM
into to their system for such building/booting test.

So for this issue, it should be very easy to find and email to the author.

Thanks,
