This has to do with how power sequences are enabled during the build. Instead 
of providing yet-another-kernel-option, I thought it would be better to make 
it invisible and let drivers that take advantage of power seqs enable the 
option by themselves when they are selected. That's why power sequences are 
unconditionally compiled when pwm-backlight is selected.

But on the other hand, pwm-backlight already has a DT interface that does not 
use power sequences, and its current users are still relying on the legacy 
platform data interface (with one PWM and some callback functions). Making the 
power sequences mandatory in the DT bindings would make it impossible to use 
that legacy interface.

We could make power sequences an option of its own and add #ifdefs to drivers 
that use it to lift this ambiguity, but I like the transparency of the current 
way. It also seems hard (illegal?) to get rid of the legacy DT interface.

Alex.
