What I currently do is pass the ECAM space as a resource to the PCI host
bridge platform device. Regular and extended configuration spaces are
given by the third and fourth resources, respectively. If I understand
correctly, you're saying that nothing beyond that needs to be encoded.
In other words it is enough for the PCI host bridge driver to know where
to take the data from.

I'll have to see what this means for the DT binding. There are other
issues that I need to think about, like for example how to pass the ECAM
space from the PCI host controller to each of the two bridges via the
ranges property. This no longer makes sense in the current form, as the
ECAM covers the configuration spaces for devices of both bridges and
cannot really be split among them.
