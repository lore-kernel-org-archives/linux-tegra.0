Given how this didn't work at all for v4.1, why don't we try to do this
the conventional way for v4.2? What I propose is that I collect all the
patches that I've had in these branches into a single branch that I can
send you shortly after v4.1-rc1. Then you can pull that into the clock
tree when you're happy and I can pull that into the Tegra tree again if
needed to resolve dependencies.

One problem that I foresee is that the EMC clock driver relies on some
symbols exported by the EMC driver, so it will fail to build on its own
if merged into the clock tree. Usually I'd say we can solve this by
merging a stable branch from the Tegra tree into the clock tree, but if
any of the ARM SoC maintainers then decides that, for whatever reason,
the Tegra pull request isn't good enough, you'd need to either redo the
clock tree or we slip in the changes via the clock tree anyway.

Perhaps a solution would be to implement stubs for the API exposed by
the EMC driver and merge that through the clock tree, which should give
us a tree that can be built but be a no-op at runtime. Then we can add
the actual code to enable EMC scaling in the Tegra tree by providing a
real implementation. That way we only have the Tegra tree depend on the
clock tree.

How does that sound?

Thierry
