This series includes patches to a lot of different subsystems. That will
complicate applying it.

Can you write a summary of the *compile time* dependencies, since that
will influence how the patches get merged.

You mentioned that this series depends on efuse and XUSB padctl. Can you
point out which specific parts of this series depend on which of those
two other series, and whether this is a compile-time or run-time dependency.

I hope that the drivers/ata patches, drivers/clk patches, DT, and
defconfig patches can each be applied to their normal tree and don't
depend on each-other at compile-time at all.

At run-time, obviously all the patches are needed to make the code work,
but since this is a new feature, it's fine if this all only works once
everything is merged together in linux-next or Linus's tree.

Thanks.
