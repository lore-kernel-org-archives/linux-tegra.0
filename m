Deferring the population might complicate the common code by changing
the time that devices get created. Right now the code is oriented around
doing it all at once.

However, it would be possible to cause a probe deferal on devices that
requires an IOMMU in a way that it would be triggered by the bus instead
of by the individual device drivers.

I don't really know the details well enough to comment intelliently.
Craft up the patches and see what it looks like.

It seems a little fragile to me too. I'd rather the IOMMU requirement be
described more explicitly.
