This is the case for all Renesas SoCs that have power areas: devices belong
to both the PM domain for the power area, and to the PM domain for the clock
domain.

See setting of .attach_dev in
    arch/arm/mach-shmobile/pm-rmobile.c (power areas + clock domain)
    drivers/clk/renesas/clk-mstp.c (pure clock domain)
    drivers/clk/renesas/renesas-cpg-mssr.c (pure clock domain)
    drivers/soc/renesas/rcar-sysc.c (power areas + clock domain)

AFAIK there are no devices that belong to multiple power areas (power areas may
be nested though, which is handled fine by the current framework, as created by
Rafael when he worked on Renesas SoCs).

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
