I would like to see an ack from the core ARM maintainer (Russell) on
patch 1/5 (also CC'ing arm-soc maintainers for their opinion).

If I get that, I think it makes sense to take the series through the
Tegra tree. I can always create a stable branch for patch 1/5 if needed
to resolve conflicts elsewhere (e.g. Russell's trees or arm-soc) and/or
allow other people to build on top of that patch.
