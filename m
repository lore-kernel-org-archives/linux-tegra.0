Maybe a bigger change to the reduce the complexity of
the state machine would solve that problem and also
reduce code complexity... 

I may find some time over the weekend if no solution
has been found until then.

The way I would envision it it would have a “state”
as a level (0=shutdown, 1=hw enabled, 2=in pump, 
3=in transfer, 4=in hw-mode,...) and a complete
to allow waking the shutdown thread (and by this
avoiding the busy wait loop we have now).
This would replace those idling, busy, and running flags.

Drawback: it is invasive, but let us see what it
really looks like...
