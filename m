We got the exact same problem with GPU and VPR registers, and it seems
like the approach we will be taking here is to have the
firmware/bootloader do whatever is needed to get the GPU working and
enable the DT node once it did. IOW, the kernel will never touch
protected registers, and will not freeze if the hardware is not
properly set up.

It would be nice for consistency if the same approach can be taken
with the IOMMU. OTOH we will need to make sure that all these
initialization contracts are clearly documented somewhere. Maybe a
comment in the DTS to explain what is expected from the firmware to
enable such nodes would be a good idea, too.
