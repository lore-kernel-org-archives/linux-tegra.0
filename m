That might only exist in linux-next.

The TEGRA_AES driver has been removed, so the option should be removed
from defconfig too. I don't know what happened to PROC_DEVICTREE - it
doesn't seem to exist any more. Was it replaced by something else or
deleted? Feel free to send patches for those.

Is this useful with DT? I thought that unlike I2C_CHARDEV, spidev needed
dummy devices to exist in DT for spidev to work? If so, there's not much
point adding the option to defconfig, since people can add it when they
put the dummy devices into DT.
