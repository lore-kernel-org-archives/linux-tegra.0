I see. I do like the idea of it, because it is more straightforward than
representing the whole sequence in DT. Matching could be done using the
standard compatible property.

However this also means we'll essentially just be moving the board code.
Being in a central location it would be easier to refactor commonalities
though.

The amount of work required by the board developer would largely depend
on whether support for the panel is already present or not. For new
panels this would mean that a new driver needs to be written, while
representing the power sequence in DT might be easier to do, and readily
available from some datasheet.

I haven't worked with many different panels, so maybe I can't judge this
too well, but if panel drivers were kept in a central location, then the
number can be reduced by generalizing parts of existing drivers.
