Some explanation of why this "may or may not be equal to the actual base
clock frequency" would be nice.

Presumably, it's because the clock frequency is supplied by the clock
controller module, and configuring that happens externally to the SD
controller, so the SD HW has no knowledge of the actual frequency, and
hence simply reports a hard-coded maximum possible clock frequency?

It's not clear to me from the function name that
sdhci_pltfm_clk_get_max_clock() simply calls clk_get() on the actual
clock. It might be nice to mention that in the commit description.
