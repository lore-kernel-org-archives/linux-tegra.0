Oh, I'm not disputing that at all. I just think it's worth considering how
we can extend the binding in future to describe some of the ID routing and
remapping that we've discussed.

For any old arbitrary mappings, we're going to have a rough time, but that
doesn't mean we need to support that until we're forced to (and then we can
consider our options). What I *do* think we need to describe is:

  - Each master has a set of fixed StreamIDs
  - StreamIDs can be remastered by adding a constant offset (this could also
    be used to describe RequesterID -> StreamID mapping)

I'd hope this would be sufficient for most people. Dynamic ID assignment can
be worked out later (I'm not even sure it belongs in this binding) and any
mappings other than `add a constant offset' can be treated on a case-by-case
basis. We don't want to throw the kitchen sink at a language for describing
arbitrary transformations!

If we can support 90% of SoCs with a simple DT-based description, we can
address the corner cases as they arise. I'm not ruling our hardcoding
topology if we have no choice, but I don't think that's a healthy place to
start from.
