Given that, the only patches in this series that should be merged touch 
(a) pm_qos, (b) tegradrm. As such, I would suggest that patch 1 be 
merged into the pm_qos tree in a standalone topic branch, and Thierry 
can merge this into the Tegra tree and apply patch 2 when he's ready.

Since patch 3 is the only patch that would normally go through the Tegra 
tree, and patch 3 isn't to be applied yet, I don't intend on applying 
any of these patches to the Tegra tree.
