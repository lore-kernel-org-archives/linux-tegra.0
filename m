I don't completely follow, but that's ok ;-)

Ok. I'm fine with having one driver in drivers/soc for the pmc (and
a few associated bits if necessary) and a header file for that. If you
end up with two separate drivers in drivers/soc, I'd also prefer two
separate header files.

It may be a good idea to put these headers somewhere other than
include/linux/*.h, which is completely overloaded by random stuff.
We could use include/linux/soc/*.h or include/soc/*.h for those.
