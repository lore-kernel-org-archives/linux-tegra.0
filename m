To expand on this a bit more, I can't find any reference to register
CCLKG_BURST_POLICY in arch/arm/mach-tegra/ or drivers/clk/tegra/ except
for the definition of clock cclk_g, nor any reference to that clock in
those two directories. And that CCLKG_BURST_POLICY register is what this
patch saves/restores.

I do see function tegra30_switch_cpu_to_clk32k in patch 5/8 appears to
do something related to switching to clk_m and touches some other
burst-related registers, but not CCLKG_BURST_POLICY...

So, if this syscore_op is attempting to undo some change that happens to
CCLKG_BURST_POLICY during suspend, I still can't see what change is
happening to that register during suspemd, nor which piece of code
causes it.

If the issue is that the value in this register is simply lost during
LP1 because the power is turned off, then I wonder what sets up this
register during the original boot path?
