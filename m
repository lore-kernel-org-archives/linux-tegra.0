Isn't the state machine setup something that the EMC driver does through
EMC registers (or perhaps also using flow controller registers?). If all
the clock driver does for this clock is program the requested rate,
which triggers the HW state machine, then I think we can isolate
everything else into the EMC driver.

In such a case, we don't need to use pre-/post-rate change notifiers at
all; just have the EMC driver call into the clock driver at the
appropriate step in the process where the clock registers should be written.

Well, we can certainly make that happen. We're writing the code behind
clk_set_rate() for the EMC clock after all...

But I'm not sure why that is a requirement. If it is, we're pretty
screwed, because surely there's nothing stopping some other driver
that's running on a different CPU from coming along and changing some
completely unrelated clock, which will then touch "some other register".
