As per the Tegra TRM primary, secondary and subordinate default
bus numbers are 0 and it is expecting SW to program these numbers.
I believe this is the reason for adding PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_RSRC and
PCI_REASSIGN_ALL_BUS flags.

Looking at the function pci_scan_bridge_extend(), if secondary and
subordinate bus numbers are 0 it is assigning bus numbers even if
these flags are not set.

In the basic testing with one endpoint PCIe link up is working
fine without these flags, however I would like test with PCIe switch
and multiple endpoints connected to Tegra.
