I had a look at the Video decode block (for msm8996), which seems to be powered using 3 different
powerdomains, mainly venus, venus_core0 and venus_core1. The venus PD powers the ARM core
which runs the firmware, while the venus_core0 and venus_core1 power the encode/decode logic,
so for things like firmware image loading you ideally need only venus PD to be ON, but during
an encode/decode operation you would need all 3 to be ON.
The downstream driver turns *all* of them together, and does not control them individually.
For upstream, the way we have it working (the driver is not merged) is by having venus be the parent
of venus_core0 and venus_core0 as the parent of venus_core1, and having venus_core1 mentioned as
the powerdomain for the video decode block in DT.

So in summary, there is still no need to control them individually, but given there is no way to
specify more than one powerdomain for a given device, we are ending up hooking up some 
parent/child relations in the powerdomain code.

Rajendra
