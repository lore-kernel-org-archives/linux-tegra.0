Adding /cpu nodes to DT is trivial, but I would like to keep a fall back
mechanism in place for existing platforms to carry out the transition
as smoothly as possible (eg people using new kernels with old DTS).

/cpu nodes will have priority over HW based probing for cores counting.

As discussed with Hiroshi I will post a patch to provide platforms with
a DT cpu map validity check so that the fall back mechanism can be
triggered properly.

Thank you very much,
Lorenzo
