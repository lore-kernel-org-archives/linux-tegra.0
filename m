Okay, thanks for clarifying this.

Thinking about this as bit more, when I realized that *if* we would
add a new PM domain framework for explicit control of PM domains, that
would mean you need to deploy support for that in the drivers.

On the other hand, as you anyway would need to change the drivers, you
could instead deploy clock support in the drivers, which would avoid
using the clock domain. In that way, you could still stay with one PM
domain pointer per device, used to control the power domains instead.
Right? Or would that have other implications?

Kind regards
Uffe
