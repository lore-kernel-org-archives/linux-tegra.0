Ah, I see - tegra20_power_up_cpu() runs first to boot the secondary CPU,
and tegra_secondary_init() runs on the secondary CPU during the boot
process, which then sets tegra_cpu_init_mask which influences what
tegra20_power_up_cpu() does next time around. It'd be useful to say that
in the patch description.
