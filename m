FWIW, I've started listing the legal values as explicit separate bullet 
items rather than prose. See the example below - all those entries are 
just one string simply due to the HW design it represents, but each 
entry could be a list (i.e. is a complete compatible value):

- compatible
     Array of strings.
     One of:
     - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio".
     - "nvidia,tegra186-gpio-aon".

could be expanded as e.g.

     - "nvidia,tegra999-gpio", "nvidia,tegra186-gpio"
     ...
