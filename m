Do you see it touch the SDHCI_TEGRA_VENDOR_MISC_CTRL register?

The TRM states ...

"SDMMC_SPARE0[4] : When set, SD3.0 support is advertised in
SDMMC_SLOT_INTERRUPT_STATUS_0_SPECIFICATION_VERSION_NUMBER Otherwise,
only SD2.0 support is advertised"

So I *believe* this means that the sdhci version will now appear as 3.0
and so the host->version == SDHCI_SPEC_300. There are many places in the
sdhci driver where it is checking ...

 if (host->version >= SDHCI_SPEC_300)
	 ...

I will take a look.
