Thanks. I was wondering if there are others. Do you know what the
correct setting should be? Ie. should it be IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING as
well? I can then include this with OMAP and Tegra.

I am not sure I fully understand your proposal, but please note that it
may not be just limited to the TWD (although this does appear to be the
one client that is wrong for a lot of SoCs). PPIs are also used for the
armv7/8 timers as well.

The problem is that we have a lot of SoCs with twd-timers and I have no
way to test all of these to know which could be a problem. So I thought
that warning would be a good first step to fixing them.

However, I am still trying to see the real value in returning an error
in this case. May be I am the only one with that perspective?

Cheers
Jon
