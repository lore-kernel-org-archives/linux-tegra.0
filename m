This looks a suboptimal to me: if you have n devices sharing the same PM
domains, you would add n new subdomains?

Having a clean way to specify multiple PM domains is very useful, though.

E.g. on Renesas ARM SoCs, devices are usually part of two PM domains:
  1. A power area (can be "always-on",
  2. The clock domain.

As power areas and clock domains are fairly orthogonal (the former use the
.power_{off,on}() callbacks, the latter set GENPD_FLAG_PM_CLK and use the
{at,de}tach_dev() callbacks), we currently setup both in the same driver
(SYSC, for controlling power areas), which forwards the clock domain operations
to the clock driver (CPG/MSTP or CPG/MSSR).
Hence we have only single references in the power-domains properties, but
having two would allow to drop the hardcoded links between the two drivers.

(Oh no, more DT backwards compatibility issues if this is accepted ;-)
