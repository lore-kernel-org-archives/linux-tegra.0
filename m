Linus, what do you think of Lucas's proposal?

As background, the Tegra HW design implies that all initial pinmux setup 
should be applied one time early during boot before peripherals are 
used. That means it should happen early in boot code, not once an OS 
like Linux has been loaded, since loading the OS requires use of at 
least some peripheral(s). Hence, there's no point the kernel re-applying 
the same configuration.

I had suggested (in this patch) removing the pinmux completely from the 
DT, since no OS should need it. However, the Barebox bootloader is 
configured via DT, and so wants to keep the pinmux configuration in the 
DT, rather than embedding the pinmux tables into the bootloader's board 
support code. Lucas has suggested simply changing the pinmux state name 
in the DT so that the kernel won't apply the pinmux configuration yet 
it's still there for the bootloader to use if it wants.

I'd suggest "boot" rather than "initial" myself for the new state name, 
but that's just bike-shedding.
