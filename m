The I2C controller a/k/a the I2C master.

Yes; the dependency of some nodes on pinctrl isn't explicitly called out 
in the DT. It's probably not a good idea to have such implicit 
dependencies, although I suppose for something so central as pinmux, 
maybe it's not terrible, since almost everything depends on it and it's 
pretty obvious.
