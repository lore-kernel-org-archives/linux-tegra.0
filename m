I have been looking and asking around, and seems like we should
actually leave FIQs enabled when the tick is frozen and only disable
them within enter_freeze.

My understanding is that FIQ handlers are extremely limited in what
they can do, with the main use being NMI-like functionality. There are
a handful of other FIQ handlers in mainline, but they don't call into
any other kernel code and limit themselves to doing some basic I/O.

The only reason why they should be disabled in enter_freeze is that
the context of the CPU that is going to a lower power state could
become corrupted if a FIQ gets fired during a save or restore
operation.
