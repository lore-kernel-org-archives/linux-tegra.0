I can very much relate to the above mentioned problem, where code
modifications done as a part of cpuidle framework needs to be
reflected in every arch back-end cpuidle driver.
We do have added advantages in moving
all the back-end drivers into drivers/cpuidle.
This would help us achieve better reviews, easier consolidations
and more importantly maintaining sync btw drivers and framework and
the up-streaming process.

But then, this means we get all the
arch specific code out under drivers/cpuidle
which can be very messy. Also instances where the changes
are specifically tied only to the  architecture of the back-end driver
(SoC specific), it is absolutely necessary to get SoC maintainer's review.
