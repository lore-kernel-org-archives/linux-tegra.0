Greg, here's the update patch with the above explanation. Please take
this one if the following explanation makes sense.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Driver Core: don't oops with unregistered driver in
 driver_find_device()

driver_find_device() can be called with an unregistered driver. Need
to check driver_private to see if it's populated or not, especially
under deferrable probe.

In the case that there are 2 drivers, one depends on the other. With
-EPROBE_DEFER, two drivers can use deferred probe to ensure that their
relative probe order doesn't matter. If dependee driver is probed
first, then the dependant's driver_find_device('dependee')
succeeds. If the dependant is probed first, then the dependant's
driver_find_device('dependee') should return NULL, and the dependant
should get -EPROBE_DEFER. driver_find_device() needs to return NULL if
it's not populated.

In [PATCHv5 2/3] ARM: tegra: Add SMMU enabler in AHB:
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.tegra/4658

"tegra_ahb_driver" may not be populated when it's called.
