That all sounds very complicated for little gain. Disabling PM doesn't
make much sense these days, so I'd personally be fine to unconditonally
enable PM on Tegra. I'm not sure what the correct way would be. Since
the PM symbol is user-visible, selecting it doesn't sound like a very
good solution, though a quick grep shows that some architectures do
this.

Rafael, do you know what the canonical way is to make !PM invalid for a
platform?
