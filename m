Overall, this driver could use comments describing how it works. Even a 
few or a few tens of lines describing the general structure of how 
messages pass from the initial client's function call into the IPC 
memory and back up to the return to the original caller would be useful. 
There seem to be many varied paths for this, and it's a bit difficult to 
reverse engineer which are used when and why.

This deserves a comment to describe what the offset/count/timeout 
represent. It took me a while to realize that each CPU had its own 
channel in IVC memory, and there was a pool of channels for threads to 
use. At least, that's what I reversed engineered is going on... (Having 
only used BPMP from U-Boot, where there's only a single CPU/thread 
active ever and no IRQs, hence we always use channel 0).

Shouldn't struct mrq_request from bpmp_abi.h be used instead of 
redefining this?

As I mentioned elsewhere, I'm not totally convinced that the BPMP driver 
should be anything more than a fairly transparent IPC channel; all the 
clock/reset/... stuff could be shuffled entirely into child devices.

Oh I see; the clock/reset code isn't actually separate drivers (like 
MFD), but just a set of functions that run "in the context of" the main 
BPMP driver. Maybe that's OK, but I was expected more MFD style, hence 
various other comments related to this topic, like just above.

(FWIW, I've been mostly in U-Boot-land recently, and the driver model 
there requires each device to be of a separate class like clock, reset, 
... so the only option is separate MFD style sub-devices. However, the 
Linux subsystems allow a single device to implement various subsystems 
at once. No doubt U-Boot's model has warped my thinking a bit.)

Those don't seem to be used; can they be dropped?

Those are only used inside the BPMP driver itself right now at least 
(i.e. not in the clock/reset drivers in this series). Can they be static 
rather than public?

It'd be nice if bpmp_abi.h defined those, but I know it doesn't:-(

That property name isn't defined by any DT binding. I think it's 
left-over from an old I2C sub-node binding.

I'm confused by the function name; this doesn't seem to be freeing 
anything. Is it really tegra_bpmp_get_next_free_tx_frame() or something 
like that? Same for tegra_bpmp_wait_master_free() below.

I believe an MRQ is a type of message, not the identity of an individual 
message. As such, there can be multiple instances (message) of a 
particular type/MRQ. Is there code somewhere to ensure that only a 
single request of any given type is outstanding at a time? I'm not sure 
why anything would ever be looked up by MRQ...

virt seems to be allocated and copied from, but never used in the IPC 
transaction.

Shouldn't that always call complete()? tegra_bpmp_transfer() always call 
wait_for_completion_timeout(), irrespective of the flags value.

I suspect those should be message_size and message_queue, otherwise the 
variable names sound like they should be pointers to objects, not 
properties of the objects.

I think this synchronously waits for the single channel in question to 
reset, one-by-one. Won't that take rather a long time; wouldn't it be 
better to initialize an start-the-reset-of all channels, then wait for 
the reset to complete across all channels in parallel?

Is this function necessary? It doesn't seem to do anything with the 
response data except pass it to dev_dbg() which probably doesn't do 
anything.

Can that boiler-plat be replaced with module_init_driver(); IIRC that's 
appropriate and often used even for non-modular drivers?
