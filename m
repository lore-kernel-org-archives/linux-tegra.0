I think gcc should remove all of that in this case, since board_init_funcs
becomes unused when the only code that references it cannot be reached,
and when that array is gone, the now unused functions would be removed
as well.

We have had bugs with prerelease gcc versions that did not handle cases
like this in the way we want it, but I think all releases get it right.
I don't think it's mandated anywhere in the C99 standard that this is
what happens, but we do rely on it anyway AFAIK.

Yes, makes sense.

Ok.
