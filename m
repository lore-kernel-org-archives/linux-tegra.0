This is very cool! How did you debug it, or did it work on the first 
try? :) I have a TF201 myself, probably quite similar to this, might be 
worth a try.

This URL doesn't work for me at least in the browser, but 
https://rere.qmqm.pl/git/?p=linux;a=summary works.

Regarding the USB device mode - yes, there are several drivers for 
roughly the same hardware. It would be good to get both host and device 
mode with the same driver so that we could have OTG support.

Cheers,
