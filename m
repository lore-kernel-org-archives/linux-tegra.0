There is *always* board specific code. There is always something fiddly
enough, complex enough, or just plain ugly enough that it is best
handled in C code. The trick is to make the board-specific stuff the
exception, not the rule.

When you can factor out common behavour (like you are doing here), then
it is a really good candidate for a common binding, but still please
always ask yourself the question is this going to make things better or
worse in the long run.

I disagree... see below.

No matter how it is encoded, this *IS* a new DSL. Using nodes and
properties doesn't change that. Extensibility is no more built-in and
free with nodes that it is with another encoding. If there aren't clear
guidelines on how to extend it then we'll get weird stuff. For example,
even with the nodes case someone might do this:

	step3 {
		type = "loop";
		count = 10;
		step1 {
			type = "gpio";
			gpio = <&gpio 1>;
			value = 1;
		};
		step2 {
			type = "delay";
			value = 10000;
		};
		step3 {
			type = "gpio";
			gpio = <&gpio 1>;
			value = 0;
		};
		step4 {
			type = "delay";
			value = 10000;
		};
	};

And even while cringing as I type the above, I also have to consider
that looping may just be a valid use case for sequences.

And even here, a very simple sequence fragment required 22 lines of
code.

Next, I'm concerned about where these will show up. Say for instance
there needs to be a power sequence added to an spi bus node. Already spi
bus child nodes have a defined meaning; they are spi slaves. How then
should the sequence be attached to the spi bus?

Okay, here are 3 concrete objections with the proposed binding:
- The syntax concerns of it being too verbose and it effectively uses
  line numbers for ordering (Do you remember fighting with BASIC?).
- There are many devices that won't be able to use the binding because
  they already have a meaning for child nodes
- I think resources should be declared separate from the sequence based
  on the assumption that multiple steps will be operating on the same
  resource.

I do think that each sequence should be contained within a single
property, but I'm open to other suggestions.
