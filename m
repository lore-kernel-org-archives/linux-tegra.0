You might want to have a look at the sdrm patches I recently posted to
dri-devel and arm Linux Kernel. Among other things they allow to
register crtcs/connectors/encoders seperately so that each of them can
have its own representation in the devicetree. I haven't looked into
devicetree support for DRM, but with or without devicetree the problem
that we do not have a single PCI card for registering all DRM components
is the same.
