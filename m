Hi Thierry,

 From the 0/9:

We would like to use upstream driver for RCE (and probably AON and SCE)=20
mailbox handling, too. Eventually.

I'm afraid that information must be stored in the device tree.

Which TRM you mean? Something here?

I browsed through he Xavier_TRM_DP09253001v1.pdf HSP section and I could=20
not find any recommendations? But see below.

Only top0 has 8 interrupts, rest of the HSP blocks have only 4 (or 5 in=20
case of top1) interrupts per HSP available through LIC. Hogging two of=20
them means that only two VMs can access a HSP.

Nope, the driver should clear only the IE register for the shared=20
interrupt that the driver uses. Other IEs are used by other entities.

Yes, that is what we should do. Again the directionality should be=20
specified in DT.

On virtualized configs, multiple VMs can use same HSP block but each VM=20
must use its own interrupt. Because all the IE registers are on the same=20
64 KB page, the writes to the page are trapped by hypervisor, which=20
means that enabling or disabling an interrupt via the shared IE register=20
is pretty heavy operation. The per-mailbox IE registers are on a page=20
accessed freely by the IE, no need to trap.

If a VM uses only one empty mailbox interrupt, using a dedicated=20
"shared" interrupt and disabling that in GIC could be a lighter=20
operation, we used to do that in Parker.
