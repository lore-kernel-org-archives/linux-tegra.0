I assume you want to map a set of pages into contiguous chunk in io address space.
This can be done with dma_map_sg() call once IOMMU aware implementation has been
assigned to the given device. DMA-mapping implementation is able to merge 
consecutive chunks of the scatter list in the dma/io address space if possible
(i.e. there are no in-page offsets between the chunks). With my implementation 
of IOMMU aware dma-mapping you usually you get a single DMA chunk from the 
provided scatter-list.

I know that this approach causes a lot of confusion at the first look, but that
how dma mapping api has been designed. The scatter list based approach has some
drawbacks - it is a bit oversized for most of the typical use cases for the 
gfx/multimedia buffers, but that's all we have now. 

Scatter lists were initially designed for the disk based block io operations, 
hence the presence of the in-page offsets and lengths for each chunk. For 
multimedia use cases providing an array of struct pages and asking dma-mapping 
to map them into contiguous memory is probably all we need. I wonder if 
introducing such new calls is a good idea. Anrd, what do think? It will 
definitely simplify the drivers and improve the code understanding. On the 
other hand it requires a significant amount of work in the dma-mapping 
framework for all architectures, but that's not a big issue for me.

Yes, I'm aware of this issue I'm currently working on solving it. I hope to use 
standard vmalloc range for all coherent/writecombine allocations and get rid of
the custom 'consistent_dma' region at all.
