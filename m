Rereading this, I think I understand what you meant.  I misunderstood
because of your reference to WFI, which is not entered at this point.
WFI generally refers to the shallowest idle state, which only affects
a single cpu.  For deeper states, the cpu may or may not execute the
WFI instruction to trigger the transition (depending on the platform),
but it's not really entering WFI, and the cpu will generally not ever
execute the next instruction (again, depending on the platform).

=46or coupled cpus, only one cpu is capable of booting first, so all
interrupts should be masked on cpu1 by the time it gets to its low
power state, so it should never abort.  If it does abort (like the
example Kevin Hillman just posted to the end of this thread), cpu1
needs to set a flag to say it is not going to get to idle, and cpu0
needs to wait for cpu1 to be in idle (by polling a power controller
register), or for the flag to be set.  Afterwards, the cpus need to
resynchronize and reset the flag, which will be easy with the parallel
barrier helper function that will be included in the next patch set.
