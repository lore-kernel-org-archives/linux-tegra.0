In this sequence we are switching from the DFLL clock source (which
directly controls the voltage) back to a PLL (which does not control the
voltage directly). What we want to do is to restore the voltage back to
the voltage it was operating at before we switched to the DFLL clock
(which could have changed it).

I am not familiar with regulator_sync_voltage() but from the comment it
does say that it will re-apply the last voltage that was configured for
the regulator. So I can see what they were doing. The question I have
is, if the consumer has not explicitly called regulator_set_voltage()
then what does regulator_sync_voltage() do? I am wondering if we should
have been doing a regulator_get_voltage() during the probe and a
regulator_set_voltage() when switching back?
