The problem is from my merge to -tip.

Yes, again my apologies. When I applied Stephen's original patch to the
recent tree, I mis-resolved the conflict.

I suspect Ingo won't squish down the fix onto the misresolved patch,
since -tip usually preserves history. But hopefully we can get this
merged quickly.

Again, sorry for the trouble!
