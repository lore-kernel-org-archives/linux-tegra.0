I've played with that approach too (as my patches for dtc do contain th=
e
same code I've put into the kernel, but decided that it doesn't make
much sense. The sort algorithm is really small (some dozen lines), very
fast (around 3-5ms on a omap) and might be later used to sort necessary
module loading too. So there would be no advantage to put a sorted list
into the DT. And having the sort algorithm in the kernel, would make it
possible to use it for acpi or something else too, if they manage it to
provide the necessary dependencies.
