That's got nothing to do with multi-master; it's got to do with the fact
that an out-of-band /CS signal is what selects devices rather than
in-band data on the bus.

I find it much more likely that /CS would be a synchronous input to the
SPI state machine in the HW. That way, the chip designers don't have to
worry about issues with asynchronous resets.

Anyway, both our arguments are pure conjecture. The only way to tell for
sure is for you to go read the datasheets for the individual devices and
find out if they document any requirements for the clock signal when /CS
isn't active. It'd be good if you could check that.

... but I suppose that since in practice you're not seeing any issues,
the DT is fine for now. It's not like this can't be changed later if we
find out there is an issue.
