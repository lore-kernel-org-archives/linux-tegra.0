Yes, that's correct; I "typo"d the example I gave.

The general feedback I've received is that regulators should always be
present, and simply implemented by fixed/dummy regulators if missing in
a particular board design, rather than having the driver code handle
them being optional. This certainly does simplify the driver, since it
can always unconditionally program the regulator irrespective of whether
it's fixed/dummy or not.
