If we make ARCH_TEGRA select PM, then moving to a multi-platform kernel
isn't automatically going to increase the image size. The image size is
only going to increase if you select ARCH_TEGRA to be part of the multi
platform image.

Yeah, there's also a fair amount of per-SoC code that can't be built as
a module and which will be included in multi-platform images when the
corresponding ARCH_* symbol is enabled. But I think that's inevitable
given the purpose of multi-platform images.

ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM selecting PM would include PM unconditionally, even
if none of the selected platforms require it. In my opinion an explicit
select from platforms that require PM would be cleaner. It could be that
once we start doing that for a single platform others might follow. When
this becomes common place it might be worth moving it up a level, but I
think explicit dependencies would be better for starters.

Right, but those won't be multi-platform kernels, right? If you know
exactly that the kernel will run in a virtual machine and that you want
to run lots of virtual machines, you probably want to build a custom
kernel.
