Has there been any progress on this? I've read the PCI mini summit notes
that you posted a while ago but it doesn't mention the pci_fixup_irqs()
issue. Was there some decision as to how this should be solved? If I
understand correctly this should solve the issue that Stephen has been
seeing with bogus interrupt assignments, so we'll need this to fix PCIe
on Tegra. Is there anything I can do to help move this forward?
