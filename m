The "is" in the middle there seems to be left-over from a previous

"the name". Also, I'm assuming that this can take a list of names, so
perhaps this should read:

	- pins: A list of strings, each of which contains the name of a pad
	    to be configured.

Do we need both of these? low-power could be a boolean property to mean
that the pad(s) should be configured in power down mode. If absent it
would mean that the pad(s) should be configured in normal mode. The only
reason why I can think of them to have to be separate is if we want to
define a configuration where the power mode is not touched. But is that
really something we need or want?

Why is this called "power-source"? This defines the signaling voltage of
the pad, so why not something like "power-level", or "voltage", or
"output-voltage"?

Or is this because it is a mux that will internally select either a
1.8 V or a 3.3 V source? In which case I guess this is okay. Perhaps
give some explanation of the mechanics of the underlying hardware to
make this more obvious.

Wouldn't these be implicitly low-power-disable? What if these are off by
default? Selecting these states would change the power source but keep
them in power down, no? Don't we want something like the below instead?

		sdmmc1_3v3: sdmmc1-3v3 {
			pins =3D "sdmmc1-hv";
			power-source =3D <TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_3V3>;
			/* low-power-disable implied here */
		};

		sdmmc1_1v8: sdmmc1-1v8 {
			pins =3D "sdmmc1-hv";
			power-source =3D <TEGRA_IO_PAD_VOLTAGE_1V8>;
			/* low-power-disable implied here */
		};

		sdmmc1_off: sdmmc1-off {
			pins =3D "sdmmc1-hv";
			low-power;
		};

That would allow the SDHCI driver to select between the two signaling
modes and a separate state for powering down the pad.

These would similarily become:

		hdmi_off: hdmi-off {
			pins =3D "hdmi";
			low-power;
		};

		hdmi_on: hdmi-on {
			pins =3D "hdmi";
		};

What about chips prior to Tegra124?
