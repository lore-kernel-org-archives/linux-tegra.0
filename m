As for the suspend/resume case I agree that the patch introduces this
limitation, but I'm not convinced that this is an actual problem.

For governor_start(): why can't the governor execute the code
before polling started, does it make any difference to the governor
that a work is scheduled?

For governor_stop(): why would the governor require polling to be
active during stop? If it needs update_devfreq() to run (called by
devfreq_monitor()) it can call it directly, instead of waiting for the
monitor to run at some later time.

Cheers

Matthias
