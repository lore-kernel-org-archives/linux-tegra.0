I believe relying on initcall ordering, even in the case where there are
enough initcall levels to achieve a particular SoC's needs, is
completely and utterly the wrong way to go.

Or at least, that's what the mantra has been for arch/arm for the last
few years. There's been plenty of active work to get away from
initcalls. Why should arch/arm64 be any different? Some consistency of
maintainer viewpoints would be nice.

(Note that I'm talking here about lots of separate initcalls that only
work in the right order due to manually assigning them initcall levels
that happen to work in the right order. Having a single initcall
function that explicitly calls all other initialization functions in the
right order is entirely different)

Disadvantages of using initcalls are:

* Not enough levels, so it's not generic/scalable.

* If you need to re-order things, you need to change the initcall level
of a bunch of stuff before/after it. This isn't scalable.

* It's hard to track them all down. Admittedly grep works, but that's a
lot more painful than just reading a function that calls other functions
explicitly.

* Each initcall has to determine if it's running on the correct HW or
not, rather than doing it once in a single top-level initcall, or in a
hook that only gets called at the right time.

Yes.
