This patch simply documents the binding that the various drivers
already require and/or whatever is already in the DT files if there
are any clocks the drivers don't currently use. I did consider fixing
up all the current usage to actually be sane, but that would require
even more driver changes (in addition to those required for the reset
framework patches).

Yes, I simply cut/paste the clock docs from one binding into the other
to make sure the wording was consistent. I guess I need to go through
and adjust the pasted format to match the various bindings. It's a
pity they're plain-text not a schema, so there is no consistency here:-(

This driver does clk_get(dev, "spi") rather than clk_get(dev, NULL),
so this requires a specific name. Again, I did consider updating all
drivers to use names, but decided I didn't want to do even more driver
changes, but instead just document what was currently required.
