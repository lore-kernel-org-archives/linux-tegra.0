Indeed, changing the EMC clock rate is a somewhat complicated sequence 
of ~10 steps. The kernel even won't let one the rate be change directly, 
as the change would be propagated to PLL_M which cannot have its rate 
changed while it is enabled. I suppose the sequence should be hidden in 
the EMC clk's set_rate implementation, which I guess would leave just 
the rate policy to this driver.
