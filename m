Do you mean firmware rather than bus here?  I think that's the confusion

It's not just the driver core logging, it's also all the individual
drivers logging that they failed to get whatever resource since silently
failing is not a great user experience.  Many, hopefully most, of the
drivers don't actually have special handling for probe deferral since
half the beauty of probe deferral is that the subsystem supplying the
resource can just return -EPROBE_DEFER when it notices something is
missing but might appear and then the drivers will do the right thing so
long as they have error handling code that they really should have
anyway.

We'd need to have a special dev_err() that handled probe deferral
errors for drivers to use during probe or some other smarts in the
logging infrastructure.  Which isn't a totally horrible idea.
