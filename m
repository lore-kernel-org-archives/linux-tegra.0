It really sucks that you're only just testing this change now, because
I've frozen my tree, and removing it for the next merge window is going
to be an entirely non-trivial matter.  You were copied on the original
patch, which you failed to test... I can't say I have _much_ sympathy
for a bug report at this point in time.

This suggests that access to the VFP coprocessor is still disabled.
However, vfp_hotplug() should have been called for CPU1 before it
gets here, which should call vfp_enable(), which should enable access.

However, what I'm wondering is...

> (__switch_to+0x34/0x58)

what the rest of the trace is.  Unfortunately, we mark __switch_to() as
"cantunwind" which means the unwinder always stops here.  It would be
really good to know what is responsible for this scheduling event,
whether it's due to a lock which is tried to be taken but is found to
be locked, but I don't think we can modify __switch_to() to allow it
to unwind (and I don't have the unwinder knowledge to hand to hack
something together.)

In order to see what's going on here, we do need to see the rest of the
trace... right now I don't have the time to be able to sort out
__switch_to() to achieve that.

As I say, you should have tested this earlier.  About the only thing I
can do now is to revert the entire original patch, which is going to be
extremely disruptive as it'll cause yet more conflicts between trees -
again, something that we want to be avoiding at this stage in the game.

Please test patches earlier.
