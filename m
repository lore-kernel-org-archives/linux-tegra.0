I've found your idea about moving device registration later during Syst=
em boot
very interesting so I've decided to try it on dra7-evem (TI) :).
It's good to know time during Kernel boot when we can assume that all d=
rivers are
ready for probing, so there are more ways to control probing order.

Pls, Note here that TI OMAP2+ mach is not pure DT mach - it's combinati=
on of
DT and not DT devices/drivers.

Ok. So What was done...

LKML Linux 4.1-rc3 (a simple case)
1) use your patches 3/4 as reference (only these two patches :)
2) move of_platform_populate later at device_initcall_sync time
Boot time reduction ~0.4 sec


TI Android Kernel 3.14 (NOT a simple case)
1) use your patches 3/4 as reference (only these two patches :)
2) move of_platform_populate later at device_initcall_sync time
3) make it to boot (not sure I've fixed all issues, but those which
   break the System boot):
 - split non-DT and DT devices registration in platform code;
 - keep non-DT devices registration from .init_machine() [arch_initcall=
]
 - move DT-devices registration at device_initcall_sync time
 - fix drivers which use platform_driver_probe().
   Note. Now there are at about ~190 occurrences of this macro in Kerne=
l.
 - re-order few devices in DT (4 devices)
 - fix one driver which uses of_find_device_by_node() wrongly
   Note. This API is used some times with assumption that
   requested dev has been probed already.
Boot time reduction ~0.3 sec. Probing of some devices are still deferre=
d.

TI Android Kernel 3.14 + of_platform_device_ensure
1) backport of_platform_device_ensure() (also need patches=20
   "of: Introduce device tree node flag helpers" and=20
   "of: Keep track of populated platform devices")
2) back-port all your patches which uses of_platform_device_ensure()
3) make it to boot:
   - drop patch dma: of: Probe DMA controllers on demand
   - fix deadlock in regulator core:
   regulator_dev_lookup() called from regulator_register() in K3.14
4) get rid of deferred probes - add of_platform_device_ensure() calls i=
n:
   - drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/dss/output.c
   - drivers/extcon/extcon-class.c

 Boot time reduction: NONE !?


So few comments from above:
- registering devices later during the System boot may improve boot tim=
e.
  But resolving of all deferred probes may NOT improve boot time ;)=20
  Have you seen smth like this?

- usage of of_platform_device_ensure() will require continuous fixing o=
f Kernel :(

- late_initcall is not (as for me not safe) a good time to register dev=
ices. A lot
  of platforms/subsystems/frameworks perform their final initialization=
 or clean-up
  steps, with assumption that System mostly ready to work. For example,=
 CPUIdle/CPUFreq
  are allowed and other PM staff. CPUIdle and driver's probing are not =
friends.

What would be nice to have for now in my opinion:
- some useful place to move device population code.
  May be machine_desc->init_device_sync() callback.
- some optional feature in DTC which will allow to re-arrange DT nodes =
for levels 0(root)
  and 1(simple-bus) using standard or widely used bindings (gpio, regul=
ators, clocks, dma,
  pinctrl, irqs).

Additional note:
- Changing device's registration order will change devices's order in
 dpm_list (drivers/base/power/main.c) and devices_kset list
 (drivers/base/core.c). This might potentially affect on suspend [1] an=
d shutdown.=20
