My branch is based on recent Linus' tree. I presume Colin will reabse
his -next on it before sending pull request...

Yeah, this is caused by issue with USB1 port reset. Greg already took
the patch that fixes it (1).

I'd rather take the ASoC for-2.6.40 and apply the first two patches +
I2C fixes.

aplay didn't complain.
