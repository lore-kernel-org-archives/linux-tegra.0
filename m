Good to hear! Thanks for taking the time to test this.

Although the patch seems ok to me in its current form, there are two 
points for which I still have small doubts:

1) Whether size_t and pointers will have the same size on all platforms. 
It not we might end up with some funny behaviors. My limited research on 
the topic did not end up with evidence that their size may differ, but I 
don't have a definite case that they do neither.
2) Whether all platforms have their address space ending at (~0). I do 
not have a concrete example in mind, but can imagine, say, a platform 
which represents its addresses as 32-bit pointers but has a smaller 
physical bus. In this case the current calculation could cause overflows 
again.

If one (or both) of these points are to be concerned about, there may 
exist macros I am not aware of that better represent the actual limits 
of pointers in the kernel.

Thanks,
Alex.
