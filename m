I was mostly illustrating.  It's not useful in most cases, unless we
have standard code parsing these bindings (probably overkill).

Sure.

For most firmware interface bindings, the backend could be implied.
The binding could be extended later if an alternative backend were needed.

If an SMC-called firmware interface is visible to a guest running under
a hypervisor at all, it is probably still callable using SMC, since
hypervisors can trap and proxy/emulate it instead of the call bypassing
the hypervisor and going straight to the Secure World.

If the interface is not visible, the hypervisor shouldn't put the relevant
node in the DT supplied to the guest (just as any physical hardware not
accessible to the guest shouldn't be described in the DT).


Firmware interfaces which don't specifically depend on the Security
Extensions need multiple backends, because hypervisors can't trap SMC on
ARMv8 platforms which don't implement the Security Extensions  -- this
was an issue for PSCI, and it's why HVC is used instead by KVM etc.

For "Secure OS" interfaces this won't be an issue since those interfaces
don't make sense if the Security Extensions aren't there.

Agreed: I don't think this makes sense as a formal binding, but rather
it's a convention we can follow which avoids DTs being unnecessarily
cryptic.
