On the other hand, noone uses barebox and you should stop with this obvious 
malice towards uboot please. I believe for most people it's easier to spend time 
only on implementing their hardware support into U-Boot, not waste time 
implementing basic components that are still missing in barebox.

Last but not least, the uImage contains additional checksum on the whole image, 
which is useful on flash media.

That said, I'm all for having uImage support in kernel and for adding this 
NOLOAD option.

Best regards,
Marek Vasut
