My first version used this actually - and you're right, having a "delay" 
step type would be more flexible and less redundant.

Keeping that in mind for the next revision.

As Thierry did - I think I will go that way.

If we can come with a way to properly use phandles within DT sequences 
(and we should), then this will only apply to platform data.

Right - more generally this needs to have both devm and non-devm variants.

The thing is that I am not sure what happens to the platform data once 
probe() is done. Isn't it customary to mark it with __devinit and have 
it freed after probing is successful?

More generally, I think it is a good practice to have data structures 
tailored right for what they need to do - code with members that are 
meaningful only at given points of an instance's life tends to be more 
confusing.

That sounds good.

Will fix that.

That's precisely what I would like to avoid - I don't need the steps to 
be numbered and I certainly have no use for a reg property. Isn't there 
a way to make it simpler?

Right, that was a clear misuse.

You can see my reply to Thierry for the reason - the only issue with 
that is caused by PWM phandles. If we overcome this, then I agree we 
should use phandles. The code should not even get more complex as I have 
to check whether a resource is already allocated with strings as well.

Thanks,
Alex.
