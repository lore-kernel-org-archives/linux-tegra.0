Sorry, but I don't see the "AND enabled" check any where in this file and
disabled irqs can be wakeup source - they shouldn't be masked.
But I'll stop commenting until i reproduce it.

Or do you mean free?

ok. seems you do mean "free".

oh :( That will require updating of all drivers (and if it will be taken into account that
wakeup can be configured from sysfs + devm_ - it will be painful).

irqchip like TI OMAP GPIO will need custom handling any way even if it's not expected
to be Powered off during Suspend or deep CPUIdle states, simply because its state
in suspend is unknown - PM state managed automatically (and depends on many factors)
and wakeup can be handled by special HW in case if GPIO bank was really switched off.

Probably yes, because most of the drivers now and IRQ PM core are not ready
for this approach.
