Yeah, I currently have code that gets the port index and the reset register
offset (ctrl_offset above) from the port address. It feels rather hackish,
though.

Both the upstream and downstream drivers currently hard-code this to dual a=
nd
411 (I assume that means 1x4, 2x1?) configurations for Tegra20 and Tegra30
respectively. Unfortunately the register AFI_PCIE_CONFIG isn't documented on
Tegra20 at all and for Tegra30 lists only the valid configurations (see
28.4.1.5 PCIe CONFIG) but not the corresponding encodings.

Maybe a good name for the new property would be "num-lanes". I also wonder =
if
this property would be better off in the parent node, which would make it
easier to check for valid configurations. Otherwise the code would have to
collect the settings of all the ports and check if the combination is valid.
Then again, having num-lanes in the parent with one cell for each controller
isn't very nice if each controller can be individually disabled.

One other thing: in addition to the device tree binding, this will all have=
 to
be represented in the platform data as well to support the legacy board
definitions currently in the tree. But instead of adding all of these chang=
es
to the patch that converts the code to a driver, I'm thinking it might be
better to split these additions off into one or more separate patches. Do y=
ou
have any objections?
