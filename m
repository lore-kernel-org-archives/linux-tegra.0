Sorry to be making noise here again, but I was eager to verify that the
fixes in v3.13-rc3 were OK on my system.  Unfortunately it seems this
patch completely broke suspend for me.  Hibernete ended up with a blank
console and no visible activity, without ever writing any image to disk=
=2E

There really weren't that many suspects between v3.13-rc2 and v3.13-rc3=
,
so I went directly to reverting 5a87182aa21d ("cpufreq: suspend
governors on system suspend/hibernate") which fixed the problem. I
didn't bother debugging it further from there. I don't think there is
anything magic about my system which should make this problem specific
to it.

I am still using the acpi-cpufreq driver on an old x86_64 laptop if tha=
t
matters.
