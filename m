I was thinking it would be nice if there was a generic way for drivers to
make changes to descriptors before a task is started.  Currently there is
host->ops->write_l() which would make it possible by checking for CQHCI_TDBR
register and, in this case, the DCMD tag.  We would need to export
get_desc(), perhaps rename it cqhci_get_desc() and put it in cqhci.h since
it is an inline function.

Alternatively we could add host->ops for descriptor preparation.

What do people think?
