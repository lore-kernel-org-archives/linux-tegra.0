I must admit, I'm having a hard time finding when the code worked like
that; ARM's bios32.c:pcibios_init_hw() seems to have always called
pci_scan_root_bus(), or ops function hw->scan(), which at least in the 1
PCIe controller driver I looked at, in turn always called either
pci_scan_root_bus() or another similar function that I believe always
called pci_bus_add_devices(), which is before pci_common_init() could
assign the resources. Maybe I'm just looking at the wrong PCIe
controller driver, or not looking back far enough in git history (or
pre-git)? If you could point out when it was working as you describe
(which sounds reasonable), I'd be interested in tracing the history from
there to see when/why it changed.
