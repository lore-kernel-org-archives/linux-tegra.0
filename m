Doing the refactoring/cleanup in a separate new branch that both of them build
on wouldn't be a bad way to do it in the future. That way dependences would
still flow in the direction we're used to (cleanups/refactor -> soc -> driver
code).

The sorting of 64-bit patches into separate branches is sort of new, in the
past we grouped all 64-bit contributions in one branch. So yeah there would be
some dependencies here. I'm personally OK with things not being buildable at
first (or, having nothing to build in the case where SoC is merged first).

I think the above could be worth considering for now.

Given that the code has been in -next through your own tree, and we're
at a very late phase in the release cycle (and I've owed you this answer
for a while, delayed due to travel and being sick), I'll merge in all
the tegra contents into one late/tegra branch that we'll aim to send in
during this merge window. We've occasionally done that on other platforms
as well when dependencies have been messy.
