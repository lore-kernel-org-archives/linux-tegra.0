I have the same understanding. We don't need GART anymore if carveout is enabled.
I'm thinking that why we need to define a property and reference to global 
/memreserve/ in GART or HOST1X node?
We can just define a label for /memreserve/, so we can distinguish these memory 
reservations already in codes.
