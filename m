But you should be using IORESOURCE_MEM; that's what it is, and that's what
all the other entries in arch/arm/mach-tegra/devices.c use.

And I don't think simply changing the type of the resource would remove
the need to request that region of MEM or IO space.

Ah right, I do see the CLK_DUPLICATE line. So, this is probably fine.

Hmmm. This still seems wrong. Hopefully somebody else more familiar with
clocks will chime in either saying this is fine, or pointing out a better
way to do this.

Why not just add complete device-tree support from the start? Since this
driver uses no platform data, isn't the of match table the /only/ device-
tree support this driver needs?
