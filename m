Ah, yes. That would actually be like an IBM pSeries, which has a windowed
IOMMU but uses one window per virtual machine. In that case, the window could
be a property of the iommu node though, rather than part of the address
in the link.

copied wrong? I guess you mean #address-cells=<0>/#size-cells=<0> here.

Yes, sounds great. I would probably leave out the Multiple-master device
from the examples, since that seems to be a rather obscure case.

I would like to add an explanation about dma-ranges to the binding:

8<--------
The parent bus of the iommu must have a valid "dma-ranges" property
describing how the physical address space of the IOMMU maps into
memory.
A device with an "iommus" property will ignore the "dma-ranges" property
of the parent node and rely on the IOMMU for translation instead.
Using an "iommus" property in bus device nodes with "dma-ranges"
specifying how child devices relate to the IOMMU is a possible extension
but is not recommended until this binding gets extended.
----------->8

Does that make sense to you? We can change what we say about
dma-ranges, I mainly want to be clear with what is or is not
allowed at this point.
