Hi Mark!

Just got access to my computer back for the weekend ;)

I actually brought this about so I see is as part of my
responsibility trying to solve the issue as well...

Does something like this looks acceptable?

SPI_CONTROLLER_MODE_EXCLUSIVE could replace the bus_lock_flag.
I am also not sure of the “convention” of memory mode (i.e
using mem_ops). Is it maybe implicitly spi_bus_locked - i.e
typically only a single device?

Essentially we would transition between these states linearly
(hopefully no jumps are needed).
