On second thought, the case I mentioned is not a problem for you
currently. You'll just have more problems once you start seeing bitflips
in erased pages.

And I agree, the latter case you mention is probably pretty unlikely,
though I'm not really an EE expert to tell you cannot see such a 0->1
"stuck bit".

But anyway, why don't you check the spare area too? It turns the
"unlikely" problem into a non-issue.

At the same time, I see that you don't support raw page reads/writes. Is
it impossible? Or is it just an oversight?

That was really just an FYI. No, the discussion didn't lead much of
anywhere. A bunch of half-assed implementations, and me with no time
(and even less hardware, now).

I'd still either like to see a good reason not to check the OOB for
oob[:] == 0xffffffff, or else fix that up. The rest (which is, like you
say, "bas[ing] this driver on top of future work") is not your problem
ATM [1].

I don't think we need to see all the formulas again, but a TRM reference
could be nice. I was asking mostly about units, and also about the
round-down division. I'll add a few more comments below.

^^ conversion to MHz? Why? (comment) How about DIV_ROUND_UP, so you
don't overestimate the clock period (and thus underestimate the number
of clock periods needed)?

> > > +	unsigned long period = 1000000 / rate;

And period is... in picoseconds? It took me a minute to figure that out
for sure, so IMO it deserves a comment.

DIV_ROUND_UP()? You don't want to lop off a partial timing cycle, right?
Simliar comments apply throughout. Or please correct me if I'm wrong.

[1] Unless, of course, you start using NAND flash that sees bitflips in
    erased pages.
