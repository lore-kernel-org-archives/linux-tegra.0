"tegra114.dtsi" has the folloiwng "tsc" entry. So can we consider that
if dts has this entry, CNTFRQ is not set, which implies it's in secure
mode. kernel should set it up by itself? Otherwise, skip this setup
and use it. For example:

 	tsc {
 		compatible = "nvidia,tegra114-tsc";
 		reg = <0x700f0000 0x20000>;
+		setup-cntfrq;
 	};

Is this what you explained in the above?
At least, kernel can survive without bootloader/firmware support, ATM.
