You are right that the DRM driver should not care about the specific
IOMMU implementation. It shouldn't matter to the graphics driver if it
sits on top of a Tegra 2 GART with a fixed aperture of 32MB or on top of
a Tegra 3 SMMU with an virtual address space of several Gigabytes. 

However graphics cores are one of the most complicated devices when it
comes to DMA resource management. Because of it's natural operation mode
as a completely parallel coprocessor to the CPU and the big amounts of
data that has to be mapped at every given time, the GPU doesn't fit
terribly well within the normal Linux Kernel DMA API.

We already have a solution for GPU address space management in the
kernel, called TTM, which in turn integrates with other things like
DMABUF. But to guarantee the best performance TTM will have to manage
the whole virtual address space of the GPU. So I think the IOMMU API is
the perfect abstraction level for interaction between the DRM and the
GART/SMMU driver. This way the DRM is able to manage the DMA resources
on it's own while staying completely agnostic about the underlying IOMMU
hardware.

Yes, this is exactly the patchset I had in mind.

No, sorry. I was occupied with other things for the last weeks and
couldn't find the time to revisit this topic.
