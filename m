Mistake or not, ePAPR already (ab)uses the address concept for PCI.
Unless ePAPR is wrong, I don't think it makes sense to argue that
the address concept cannot be repurposed.

The reason why this is abused for PCI is the same as our reason here:
different masters really are treated as distinct even when accessing
the same destination address, and DT has no general native way to
describe that.

One clear advantage of using #address-cells etc. is that ePAPR already
has very clear and well-defined ways of how to specify range mappings.
This gives us a ready-made way to describe windowed IOMMUs and 1:1
remappings of whole blocks of master IDs, which are the most obvious
cases other than having a small-integer set of explicit IDs.

That said, the PCI pseudo-address thing is not something we _necessarily_
want to repeat.

How do you envisage propagation of the master ID bits downstream of the
IOMMU would be described?

We will definitely need a way to describe this for GICv3.  How those
values are propagated is likely to vary between related SoCs and doesn't
feel like it should be baked into a driver, especially for the ARM SMMU
which may get reused in radically different SoC families from different
vendors.

The most likely types of remapping are the adding of a base offset or
some extra bits to the ID -- because not all MSIs to the GIC will
necessarily pass through the IOMMU.  It's also possible that we might
see ID squashing or folding in some systems.


For types of remapping which mix the ID and address together, I now
do tend to agree that any flexibility arising from describing that
in a general way that is unlikely to repay the cost of trying to
interpret and analyse the DT.  Defining a few sterotypical kinds
of mapping explicitly, as needed, looks more sensible for now.  The
windowed-IOMMU case is one example.
