It would be unusual for an IOMMU to need this, but it's how the DMA
mask is supposed to work for normal devices. As mentioned before, I
would probably just error out if we ever encounter such an IOMMU.

Unfortunately not all code agrees regarding how dma mask is actually
interpreted. The most important use is within the dma_map_ops, and
that is aware of the IOMMU. The dma_map_ops use that to decide what
IOVA (bus address) to generate that is usable for the device, normally
this would be a 32-bit range.

When driver code looks at the dma mask of the device itself to make
an allocation decision without taking the IOMMU or swiotlb into
account, things can indeed go wrong.

Russell has recently done a good cleanup of various issues around
dma masks, and I can't find any drivers that get this wrong.
However, there is an issue with the two or three subsystems using
"PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS" to decide how they should treat high buffers
coming from user space that get passed to hardware.

If the SCSI layer or the network layer find the horribly misnamed
PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS (which is hardcoded to "1" on ARM32), they
will create copy in low memory for any data that is above
the device dma_mask (SCSI) or above max_low_pfn (network).

This is not normally a bug, and won't hurt for the swiotlb case,
but will give us worse performance for the IOMMU case, and
we should probably change this code to calculate the boundary
per device by calling a function from dma_map_ops.

We also really need to implement swiotlb support on ARM32 to deal
with any other device (besides SCSI and network) that does not
have an IOMMU but wants to use the streaming DMA API on pages
outside of the dma_mask. We already have this case on shmobile.

The mask of the device is not even an issue here, it's more the general
case of passing a buffer outside of the IOMMU's upstream bus DMA mask
into a driver connected to the IOMMU.
