The property for enabling external rail control on the AS3722 is
ams,ext-control, not ams,external-control. Since the external rail
control property was previously being ignored, LP1 suspend on these
boards wasn't actually turning the CPU rail off at all.

So here's a dilemma, either change the existing DTs, change the
binding + driver, or make the driver recognize both properties.
I chose the first one since the old behaviour was broken in the
first place and the old DTs stay as buggy as they were before.
