But it needs #address-cells =3D <2> only to encode an ID in addition to
the address. If this was a single-master IOMMU then there'd be no need
for the ID.

This really isn't specific to IOMMUs though. It really applies to all
cases where #address-cells and #size-cells are parsed. While it's way
too late to change the semantics of standard properties, perhaps for
properties that are introduced it would make more sense to encode this
as a <start limit> pair, both of length #address-cells, to avoid this
type of corner case.

On the other hand doing so would make it inconsistent with existing
bindings which may not be desirable either.

But since it seems like we're headed for something completely different
for IOMMUs, perhaps it would be worth considering to describe the IOMMU
range as <start limit>. Since it will likely use #iommu-cells rather
than #address-cells we have an opportunity to change the semantics.

I'm not sure I understand the need for 0x100 (all IDs) entry above. If
bus1's iommus property applies to all devices on the bus, why can't the
ID 0xb be listed in the iommus property?

	bus1 {
		#address-cells =3D <1>;
		#size-cells =3D <1>;
		ranges;
		iommus =3D <&{/iommu} 0xb 0  0x1 0x0>; // 4GB ID '0xb'
		dma-ranges =3D <0  0xb 0  0x1 0x0>;

		anothermaster {
			...
		};
	};

In which case I guess dma-ranges would be redundant.

I'm somewhat confused here, since you said earlier:

But now you seem to be saying that we should still be using the
#address-cells and #size-cells properties in the IOMMU node to determine
the length of the specifier.
