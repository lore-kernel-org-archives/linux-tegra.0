Taking a quick look at the patch, it looks sane to me and pretty much
exactly what I would expect the code to look like w.r.t. handling old
bindings.

I'm glad it went that way. It shouldn't be _too_ bad to keep the
compatibility with old bindings in the code like this in most cases,
it's mostly a matter of filling in the newer structures like you did
in this patch.
