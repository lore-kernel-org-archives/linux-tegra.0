Apologies for the silence on this topic...  I'm trying to do too many
things at the sime time as usual :/

Comparing this with the other discussion thread, we have a similar
concept here, in that the iommu is made a logical parent, however...

Firstly, there's an implicit assumption here that the only kind of
thing the master could possibly be connected to is an IOMMU, with
no non-trivial interconnect in between.  I'm not sure this is going
to scale to complex SoCs.

If a range of Stream IDs may be issued (especially from something like
a PCIe RC where the stream ID may be a many-bit value), describing
the IDs individually may be impractical.

... I concur with Arnd dma-ranges is now in the wrong place with
respect to the (overridden) child-parent relationship, and that if
this device masters to multiple destinations there's no possibility
of describing different ranges mappings for each.

In theory, you could describe split ranges simply by multiplying out:

	<&/iommu 42 sub-range-1>,
	<&/iommu 42 sub-range-2>,
	...

This is only manageable if the number of subranges for each
(iommu,streamID) mapping is small (and usually 1).

Of course, I hope the number of subranges normally _is_ small...
