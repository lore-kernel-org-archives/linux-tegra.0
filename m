Oh I see.  The exported clock syms were for the 210 DMA driver and it
never crossed my mind that this driver needed the same syms in order for
it to be tristate.  Guess the exports proved useful afterall.  :)

No problem ; I will drop this patch in favor of a one line Kconfig patch
in my test queue so it doesn't trip the regular audit, just like I have
for the 210 below -- not yet submitted for the same dependency reason.

Subject: [PATCH] dma: tegra210-adma: convert TEGRA210_ADMA from bool to
 tristate

This driver currently uses modular infrastructure but is controlled
by a bool Kconfig.

There is a general consensus from the DMA reviewers and maintainers
that "if it can be modular, it should be modular" in order to keep
the bzImage size under control for multi platform kernels.

Build tested only.  Also needs some new pm_clk symbols exported
before this commit is applied to tree in order to avoid modpost
errors like:

  ERROR: "pm_clk_add_clk" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_create" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_destroy" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_suspend" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "pm_clk_resume" [drivers/dma/tegra210-adma.ko] undefined!
