Added support for dynamic clock freq configuration in pwm kernel driver.
Earlier the pwm driver used to cache boot time clock rate by pwm clock
parent during probe. Hence dynamically changing pwm frequency was not
possible for all the possible ranges. With this change, dynamic calculation
is enabled and it is able to set the requested period from sysfs knob
provided the value is supported by clock source.

Changes mainly have 2 parts:
  - T186 and later chips [1]
  - T210 and prior chips [2]

For [1] - Changes implemented to set pwm period dynamically and
          also checks added to allow only if requested period(ns) is
          below or equals to higher range.

For [2] - Only checks if the requested period(ns) is below or equals
          to higher range defined by max clock limit. The limitation
          in T210 or prior chips are due to the reason of having only
          one pwm-controller supporting multiple channels. But later
          chips have multiple pwm controller instances each having
	  single channel support.

V2:
1. Min period_ns calculation is moved to probe.
2. Added descriptioins for PWM register bits and regarding behaviour
   of the controller when new configuration is applied or pwm is disabled.
3. Setting period with possible value when supplied period is below limit.
4. Corrected the earlier code comment:
   plus 1 instead of minus 1 during pwm calculation

+ * Overview of Tegra Pulse Width Modulator Register:
+ * 1. 13-bit: Frequency division (SCALE)
+ * 2. 8-bit : Puls division (DUTY)
+ * 3. 1-bit : Enable bit
+ *
+ * The PWM clock frequency is divided by 256 before subdividing it based
+ * on the programmable frequency division value to generate the required
+ * frequency for PWM output. The maximum output frequency that can be
+ * achieved is (max rate of source clock) / 256.
+ * i.e. if source clock rate is 408 MHz, maximum output frequency cab be:
+ * 408 MHz/256 =3D 1.6 MHz.
+ * This 1.6 MHz frequency can further be divided using SCALE value in PWM.
+ *
+ * PWM pulse width: 8 bits are usable [23:16] for varying pulse width.
+ * To achieve 100% duty cycle, program Bit [24] of this register to
+ * 1=E2=80=99b1. In which case the other bits [23:16] are set to don't car=
e.
+ *
+ * Limitations and known facts:
+ * -	When PWM is disabled, the output is driven to 0.
+ * -	It does not allow the current PWM period to complete and
+ *	stops abruptly.
+ *
+ * -	If the register is reconfigured while pwm is running,
+ *	It does not let the currently running period to complete.
+ *
+ * -	Pulse width of the pwm can never be out of bound.
+ *	It's taken care at HW and SW
+ * -	If the user input duty is below limit, then driver sets it to
+ *	minimum possible value.
+ * -	If anything else goes wrong for setting duty or period,
+ *	-EINVAL is returned.
