I had looked at that initially but it was looking quite complex because
of the various structures (dev_pm_domain in the device structure,
pm_domain_data in pm_subsys_data, etc). This implementation is quite
simple and less intrusive. However, if there is a lot of interest in
this and it does appear to be, I would agree that having the device
structure handle this would be best.

I am not 100% sure I follow what you are saying, but ultimately, I would
like to get to ...

	usb@70090000 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-xusb";
		...
		power-domains = <&pd_xusbhost>, <&pd_xusbss>;
	};
