Yes.  But I think it's better if there is a single rule for interpreting 
the GPIO spec, namely look at the #address-cells property, rather than 
deciding implicitly based on the type of the referent node.

Hmmm.  I think I got the example right.

Both of the gpio controller definitions have explicit "#address-cells" 
and "#mode-cells" properties, and neither has "mode".  Both references 
to controller nodes have mode values in the user spec.

gpio1 has "mode" but not "#mode-cells", and the reference to it has no 
mode value.

gpio2 has "#mode-cells=1" but not "mode", and the reference to it has 
one mode value.

Am I missing something?

I agree that it doesn't make much sense for a controller node to specify 
the mode.  My example doesn't do that.  The only mode value is in an 
individual gpio node, not a controller node.

 From the standpoint of a SoC manufacturer, specifying modes in the 
reference is probably a good idea.  But it's not necessarily best in all 
cases.  If the focus of attention is a board design with numerous 
variants and revisions, "binding" the modes of specific gpio pins 
according to the board wiring may be the right thing.

The way I specified it lets you choose.

It makes perfect sense from one viewpoint, but I think that board 
vendors may have a different focus.  The flexibility to specify a mode 
in either place costs little, as the parsing rule is definite and 
straightforward.  SoC vendors are free to defer mode decisions until 
later, by omitting "mode" and supplying "#mode-cells" in their device 
tree templates.  Board vendors could choose either to use the SoC 
vendor's template verbatim, or to amend it with additional 
board-specific information.
