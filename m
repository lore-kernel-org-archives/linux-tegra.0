Can the version be queried at run-time from the firmware itself?

If not, I wonder if we shouldn't instead encode the version number into
the compatible value.

Some comments on the exact format of the version property would be
useful; from the example I assume it's "%02d.%02d" % (major_ver, minor_ver)?

Shouldn't that be "config ARCH_SUPPORTS_FIRMWARE", since presumably in
the future there will be more entries in the menu, and hence we want the
menu to appear if any of those entries are useful?

Or perhaps that comment is more appropriate for that "depends".
