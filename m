Hello,

Maciej moved on to work on something else and kindly allowed me to
take over the coupled regulators patches [0] which I'll try to finalize.

I recently started to work on adding DVFS support to the CPUFreq driver
of NVIDIA Tegra20/30 which require the coupled regulators functionality.
Both Tegra20 and Tegra30 have the voltage "max-spread" constraint.
Tegra30 has an additional constraint, the "max-step" voltage.

What is done in this series:

1. Re-worked the original "Add voltage balancing mechanism" patch from
   Maciej by:
        1) Fixing infinite loop within regulator_balance_voltage().
        2) Handling suspend_state_t properly.
        3) Fixing broken compilation of the patch.

2. Added pair of patches to clean up regulator-couple resolving.

3. Changed device tree binding of the regulator-coupled-max-spread property
   to make it more flexible.

4. Added new device tree property, the regulator-max-step-microvolt.

5. Implemented wait/wound mutex which was suggested by Lucas Stach in the
   review comment to [0]. I've tested w/w locking extensively (including
   CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH) and quite confident that everything is
   okay.

6. Patches were tested with KASAN on Tegra20 / Tegra30, I tried to cover
   various cases and verified that voltage constraints not violated under
   different circumstances.

Please review, thanks.
