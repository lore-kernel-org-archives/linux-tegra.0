Well, strictly speaking this isn't a regression as DDR52/50 modes were
not enable at the time when the patch was applied. However, these issues
should be addressed properly none the less.

The patch was written in preparation of implementing support for higher
speed modes like HS200 and HS400, where limiting the max_clock like that
isn't an option. Some other solution than reverting the patch has to be
found.

The fact that you're getting totally different clocks, especially on
SDR104, doesn't make much sense. I'll try to reproduce this and track
down what's going on.
