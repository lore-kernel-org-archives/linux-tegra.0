Several host bridge drivers (designware and all derivatives, iproc,
xgene, xilinx, and xilinx-nwl) don't request the MMIO and I/O port
windows they forward downstream to the PCI bus.

That means the PCI core can't request resources for PCI bridge
windows and PCI BARs.

Several other drivers (altera, generic, mvebu, rcar, tegra) do request
the windows, but use some duplicated code to do it.

This adds a new devm_request_pci_bus_resources() interface and changes
these drivers to use it.  It also fixes several error paths where we failed
to free the resource list allocated by of_pci_get_host_bridge_resources().

Tegra guys, please take a look at "PCI: tegra: Remove top-level resource
from hierarchy" in particular.  Removing the top-level resource definitely
makes /proc/iomem look uglier (although it will look more like that of
other drivers).  A short-term fix could be to include device information in
the resource name.  I think a better long-term fix would be to make the DT
or platform device core request all the resources from the DT.

Comments welcome.  I expect we'll trip over something here, so I marked
this "v1" and I don't plan to put it into -next for a while.

This is on my pci/host-request-windows branch, which you can pull or view
at https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git/log/?h=pci/host-request-windows
