Exposure is good, now we know it breaks some builds, which was useful :)

If they are "next" to a call like that, why not put it in that call?  I
really object to having to "sprinkle" this all over the kernel, for no
obvious reason why that is happening at all (look at the USB patch for
one such example.)

2 seconds is _forever_, and really seems like some other driver is
sleeping and causing this problem.  What does the bootlog time-chart say
is really causing this long delay?  There's no way we are stuck in some
sort of logic loop for that long (i.e. having to walk the list of
devices somehow.)  This sounds like a driver-specific problem that is
being worked around by having to touch all subsystems, which isn't nice.

Hint, we didn't have to do this type of thing to solve boot delays on
x86 when we had hardware that was slow to initialize, why should DT be
special?  :)

But we have deferred probing already, only those drivers that need/want
it have to do anything, why create yet-another model here?
