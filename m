I think we need to include the SKU name in the filename and compatible 
value below, or at least plan out that for other SKUs, we'll add the SKU 
name on.

I think it'd be more user-friendly if the filename and compatible value 
more obviously tied to the end-user-visible product name.

Aren't there #defines for the 5 and 0 there?

Those strings should all use the same board name as the filename, 
compatible value, and model of the root node. Based on the content in 
your patch, I would expect:

		compatible = "nvidia,tegra-audio-max98090-big",
			     "nvidia,tegra-audio-max98090";
		nvidia,model = "Google Big";

In particular, nvidia,model is used to index into 
/var/lib/alsa/asound.state by name, so it needs to be unique for each board.

That property doesn't (yet) exist in the binding/code upstream. It could 
obviously be added.
