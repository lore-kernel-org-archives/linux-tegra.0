If you are willing to help debugging then I am offering my assistance.

I would start by enabling CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG, which gives you
some more information about the runtime PM state of the device, like
the usage count for example.
I would also add a couple of prints in
tegra_xusb_runtime_suspend|resume() and in the ->power_on|off()
callbacks for the corresponding genpds, to see when those gets called.

While I was testing $subject patch I also used a local debug patch,
which adds a sysfs node that can be used to get the state of linked
suppliers for a consumer device. Feel free to use it, attached below.

Of course, the interesting part is the comparison of what happens with
and without $subject patch.
