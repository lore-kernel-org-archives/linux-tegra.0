Right, that's what I meant. Only CLK is used.

assigned-clocks is generally how we get parent clocks in this
situation. "clocks" is for what physical clocks are attached to a
given block. ARM very clearly documents the clocks for their IP
blocks.

Yes, because PERIPHCLK must be synchronous. In any case, it is
irrelevant to cpu nodes and applies to timer, SCU, and GIC nodes.
