I definitely want to have the patches as early as possible, but not
more than one pull request per branch per week or -rc ideally.

I would prefer to have all branches that I send to Linus go into the
-next through the arm-soc tree as well, not get sent there individually.

Basically, when you consider patches stable and ready for upstream
and expect no further changes, I'll pull the patches into arm-soc.git
and you can add further patches on top of the branch that I have already
pulled (not on an aggregated branch) and I can pull that again. If you
have unrelated changes, then I'd prefer them to be on top of an -rc
release for the next pull request.
