First, I don't really like extending the internal logic of genpd to
deal with multiple PM domains per device. *If* this really is needed,
I think we should try to extend the struct device to cover this, then
make genpd to use it somehow.

Second, another way of seeing this is: Depending on the current
runtime selected configuration you need to re-configure the PM domain
topology - but the device would still remain in the same PM domain.

In other words, you would need to remove/add subdomain(s) depending on
the selected configuration. Would that better reflect the HW?

Kind regards
