I should probably clarify this change. msi_base_shift =3D=3D 0 applies only
to Tegra20. This is because the implementation of the PCI host bridge on
Tegra20 has a bug that doesn't actually shift the address written to the
AFI_MSI_FPCI_BAR_ST by 8 bits to the left for matching. This was fixed
in Tegra30 (and later), hence why we have this special case in the
driver. It works around the issue on Tegra20.

A side-effect of that is that MSIs on Tegra20 can only go to the lower
32 bits of the physical address space, whereas later chips can address
the full 40 bits.

As Vidya points out, using any MSI target address > 4 GiB causes devices
with 32-bit MSI only capability to not work because they will truncate
the address and therefore the MSI controller won't be able to match at
any time.

So a proper fix is to select an MSI target address < 4 GiB for all the
chips, which would fix the regression *and* enable 32-bit MSI. However,
currently the only known regression is on TrimSlice (Tegra20), where a
change in MSI target address will fix the regression.

For all other SoCs, commit d7bd554f27c9 ("PCI: tegra: Do not allocate
MSI target memory") technically regresses for 32-bit MSI only capable
endpoints. However, since before that commit the MSI target address was
derived from an allocated page, 32-bit MSI were not guaranteed to work
either. On any system with > 2 GiB of RAM the MSI target page is likely
to be located in a region that 32-bit MSI could not address.

The offending commit d7bd554f27c9 ("PCI: tegra: Do not allocate MSI
target memory") was introduced in v4.13 and it causes a regression on
Tegra20, in particular the TrimSlice board. Other devices could be
affected, but the TrimSlice is the only one I'm aware of that people
still care about and use.

I think this meets all the criteria for merging via for-linus. I'd like
to see this fixed in v4.14 and backported to v4.13. I think we have two
options at this point: one is to apply this fix, which addresses the
TrimSlice regression but doesn't fix a potential regression on Tegra30
and later (I'm not aware of any being reported, though). I have a local
patch (attached), which should also fix that. An alternative would be to
revert the offending commit (it reverts cleanly on linux-next). In both
cases the fix/revert should be backported to v4.13.

Vidya, Jon, Mikko: can you test the attached patch? It works for me on
Tegra20 (TrimSlice), Tegra30 (Beaver), Tegra124 (Jetson TK1) and
Tegra210 (Jetson TX1, with a Realtek NIC attached). It'd be good to get
some broader coverage, though.

Subject: [PATCH] PCI: tegra: Enable the use of 32-bit MSI

Using a value above the 32-bit boundary as MSI target address prevents
devices that are only 32-bit MSI capable from using MSI for signalling
interrupts.

Fix this by relocating the MSI target address to somewhere within the
region in the address map reserved for PCI. Addresses were chosen to
be located in unused regions in the default configurations. While some
configuration could redefine the regions to include the new MSI target
addresses, doing so shouldn't cause any issues because this memory is
not actually accessed by MSI.
