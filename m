Is there no "core thermal" code? I would have expected this new feature
to be implemented in "core" code rather than of/dt "support" code.
Perhaps there would also be some additions to the of/dt code, but I'd
still expect the bulk of the feature to be complete independant of
of/dt. Systems still using board files or ACPI or ... would surely
benefit from this too?

s/tz/tzd/ or s/tz/tzdev/ ? Since "tz" says "thermal zone" to me, but
it's actually a "thermal zone device".

s/data/tz/ ? "data" is a rather generic term, and "tz" seems like a good
abbreviation for a __thermal_zone.

That seems to always apply hysteresis to the low end of a trip object.
Don't you need to apply the hysteresis to either the low or high end of
the range, depending on whether the temperature is currently below/above
the range, and hence which direction the edge will be crossed?

Similar comments elsewhere. Perhaps the patch is consistent with some
existing confusing naming style though?

Doesn't this patch modify of_thermal_get_temp() to call
of_thermal_set_trips() itself?

Passing in a struct containing fields for all the ops seem better than
forever extending this function with more and more function pointers.
