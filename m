Hi Colin,

In your patch, you put in safe state (WFI for most of platform) the
cpus that become idle and these cpus are woken up each time a new cpu
of the cluster becomes idle. Then, the cluster state is chosen and the
cpus enter the selected C-state. On ux500, we are using another
behavior for synchronizing  the cpus. The cpus are prepared to enter
the c-state that has been chosen by the governor and the last cpu,
that enters idle, chooses the final cluster state (according to cpus'
C-state). The main advantage of this solution is that you don't need
to wake other cpus to enter the C-state of a cluster. This can be
quite worth full when tasks mainly run on one cpu. Have you also think
about such behavior when developing the coupled cpuidle driver ? It
could be interesting to add such behavior.

Regards,
Vincent
