Oh, the 16-byte limit is rather annoying:-( Some of our existing DT 
files don't fit into that limit.

I'm not entirely sure that the user won't ever see those values; don't 
some X11 GUI tools display them? Still, as you say there isn't too much 
we can do, so since these names are unique/complete I figure they're OK.
