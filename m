To be honest, I don't know what order I'd like to merge things yet.
There are so many conflicting/dependant patches for 3.9 flying around
I'd need to re-read them all and think it through in quite some detail...

The common clock rework is something quite important. I'd certainly like
to get that in early. That most likely implies everything else should be
rebased on top of it.

The best thing would be if all patch authors take a look at Prashant's
clock patches (and all other patches) and work out what has dependencies
on what, and co-ordinate with each-other which order is the easiest to
merge things in. Once 3.8-rc1 is out and I can actually start merging
things, I'd like to see a list of outstanding patches from each person,
with all dependencies explicitly listed. I'll use that information to
decide which order to merge in.

Of course I just realized that Prashant hasn't posted his clock patches
upstream yet, so it's a little difficult for anyone to rebase on top of
them yet, but hopefully that will be resolved very soon now...
