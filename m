Yes, I think we should go the route that Jerome Glisse pointed out: get
in a basic KMS driver first and hide any accel ioctl under a staging
config option.

I'm really interested how this turns out in the end. I hope we can get a
somewhat stable cooperation between NVIDIA and the community, like AMD
has established at the moment.

One thing I would like to have is upstream first. We have seen much
Tegra development in both the nv-linux and chromium trees, but those
things are going upstream extremely slowly. I can understand that this
strategy was beneficial for a fast bring up of the new Tegra hardware,
but the DRM driver shouldn't be time critical and so everything should
be done to meet upstream quality from the start.
