In this case there really isn't a HW device that can be represented. But in
the end it's still the DRM driver that needs to bind to the device. However
the other graphics devices (MPE, VI/CSI, EPP, GR2D and GR3D) probably need
to be bound against.

Would it be possible for someone at NVIDIA to provide some more details abo=
ut
what those other devices are? GR2D and GR3D seem obvious, MPE might be video
decoding, VI/CSI video input and camera interface? As to EPP I have no idea.

Maybe one solution would be to have a top-level DRM device with a register
map from 0x54000000 to 0x547fffff, which the TRM designates as "host
registers". Then subnodes could be used for the subdevices.

The RGB output is programmed via the display controller registers. For HDMI,
TVO and DSI there are indeed separate sets of registers in addition to the
display controller's. So perhaps for those more nodes would be required:

	hdmi : hdmi@54280000 {
		compatible =3D "nvidia,tegra20-hdmi";
		reg =3D <0x54280000 0x00040000>;
	};

And hook that up with the HDMI output node of the "DRM" node:

	drm {
		hdmi {
			compatible =3D "...";
			connector =3D <&hdmi>;
			dc =3D <&disp2>;
		};
	};

Maybe with this setup we no longer need the "compatible" property since it
will already be inherent in the "connector" property. There will have to be
special handling for the RGB output, which could be the default if the
"connector" property is missing.

I think the mapping is always static for a given board. There is no way to
switch an HDMI port to LVDS at runtime. But maybe I misunderstand what you'=
re
saying.

Okay I see. I'll have to store it in a separate field in the private
structure then.
