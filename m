Actually this display has its own EEPROM and pins for the I2C bus. 
That's why it would seems out-of-place to have EDID taking place outside 
its driver.

But you are right that we should also handle the case where the I2C bus 
is not connected and provide a static list of videomodes (that could be 
an "offline" dump of the EDID data). However, the driver could take the 
decision to use it if the EDID bus is not specified in the DT or if 
transfer failed for some reason.

But then as you mention we might as well save time and directly serve 
that offline version, since we know the content of the EEPROM anyway.

Alex.
