Good to know, thanks!

That's what I suspected...

Ok, I expect the ship has sailed and that it's too late to actually fix
this up with active-low in various Tegra dts files and removing the negation
in the code, without causing ripples and regressions? Because that would
be the clean fix!

One other thing to possibly do is add a new binding that is not negated,
and perhaps named after the pin in the data-sheet, i.e. ti,acok-gpios,
and deprecate ti,ac-detect-gpios. But that's no fun as it leaves a bunch of
compat code that wastes space and some lucky person has to maintain it.

Perhaps the best thing to do is to just re-document ti,ac-detect-gpios
to be the inverse of what is currently described, i.e. to be AC absence
instead of AC presence? But that feels like giving up and it isn't really
nice from a device-tree point of view either, but I guess those points are
fairly accademic? Or are there any non-Linux users of this binding? How are
these things handled when they pop up elsewhere?

Cheers,
