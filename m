Uggh. I'm not thinking straight, so what I said there was backwards.

Hmm. That sounds a little churny. Why can't we just use coupled cpuidle
right from the start if the plan is to use it eventually anyway? From
other comments, it sounds like you even already have the code basically
working, but just need to iron out a bug or two?
