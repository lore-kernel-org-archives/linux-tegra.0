I would vastly prefer that the binding doc filenames use the compatible
value exactly. All (or as many as possible) of the other Tegra bindings
do this, and I think it's good style.

It didn't as far as I can tell, even though I think someone said it
should... Will it make 3.9? As a general rule, I'd like to move forward
on drivers and then refactor this aspect once the generic API/binding is
finalized and implemented.

(I couldn't find any more comments of yours below, but since the whole
patch was quoted, it was difficult to tell)
