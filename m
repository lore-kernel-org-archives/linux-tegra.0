Modern SoCs have multiple processors and various dedicated cores (video, gpu,
graphics, modem). These cores are talking to each other and can generate a
lot of data flowing through the on-chip interconnects. These interconnect
buses could form different topologies such as crossbar, point to point buses,
hierarchical buses or use the network-on-chip concept.

These buses have been sized usually to handle use cases with high data
throughput but it is not necessary all the time and consume a lot of power.
Furthermore, the priority between masters can vary depending on the running
use case like video playback or CPU intensive tasks.

Having an API to control the requirement of the system in terms of bandwidth
and QoS, so we can adapt the interconnect configuration to match those by
scaling the frequencies, setting link priority and tuning QoS parameters.
This configuration can be a static, one-time operation done at boot for some
platforms or a dynamic set of operations that happen at run-time.

This patchset introduce a new API to get the requirement and configure the
interconnect buses across the entire chipset to fit with the current demand.
The API is NOT for changing the performance of the endpoint devices, but only
the interconnect path in between them.

The API is using a consumer/provider-based model, where the providers are
the interconnect buses and the consumers could be various drivers.
The consumers request interconnect resources (path) to an endpoint and set
the desired constraints on this data flow path. The provider(s) receive
requests from consumers and aggregate these requests for all master-slave
pairs on that path. Then the providers configure each participating in the
topology node according to the requested data flow path, physical links and
constraints. The topology could be complicated and multi-tiered and is SoC
specific.

Below is a simplified diagram of a real-world SoC topology. The interconnect
providers are the NoCs.

  if any of the requests fails to apply.
