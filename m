The code below doesn't necessarily do exactly what Russell needs...

Here, the pinctrl core will call the pinctrl driver's pinmux_ops.free()
function. The whole point of this function is to change the pin's mux
selection to something that is guaranteed not to conflict with any other
pin's mux setting.

Now, if the HW only allows each signal to be routed to a specific pin
(or not routed), then free() might be a no-op.

However, if the HW allows the I2C module's signals to be routed to pins
A+B or X+Y, then free() on pins A/B would need to reprogram the mux to
route something else to pins A+B (or disable those pins or whatever the
HW needs) so that if I2C was later selected on pins X+Y, there would be
no conflict; it wouldn't be the case that both pins A+B and X+Y had I2C
mux'd on to them.

Hence, in general at least, pinctrl_disable() might glitch the output
signals.

As far as how to fix this; see my future responses to your future emails
:-)
