OK, the explanation all basically makes sense. We do clearly need to fi=
x
the DT so that the Palmas IRQ signal polarity matches what we've
configured the Tegra PMC/GIC to expect.

However, your patch was:

		palmas:=C2=B7tps65913=C2=B7{
			compatible=C2=B7=3D=C2=B7"ti,palmas";
			reg=C2=B7=3D=C2=B7<0x58>;
-			interrupts=C2=B7=3D=C2=B7<0=C2=B786=C2=B70x4>;
+			interrupts=C2=B7=3D=C2=B7<0=C2=B786=C2=B70x0>;

0 isn't valid. The replacement shouldn't be 0, but instead should be
IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW.

Alternatively, it sounds fine to leave that interrupts property as-is,
and remove the pmc's nvidia,invert-interrupt. Either sound like they
should work fine, although perhaps one polarity might cause glitches
before the inversion/... is programmed in the PMIC and/or based on
whatever pull-ups/downs are on the board?

I don't recall seeing that.

I didn't check that.
