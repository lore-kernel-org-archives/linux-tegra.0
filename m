It makes this part of the patch look funny:

because in PCIe terms, you have to have ASPM before you can have L1SS.
But the code had .has_aspm_l1ss before you add .has_aspm_l1.

It would make more sense if you could:

  1) make ASPM work, *then*
  2) incrementally add ASPM L1SS

But maybe that's not practical, e.g., maybe you can't make the
hardware hide the L1SS capability the way you can make it hide ASPM.

It's not that big a deal to me either way.
