That is correct: of_dma_configure has to set a 32-bit DMA mask
because that is the default that we expect to see in Linux drivers.

A lot of drivers don't call dma_set_mask() at all, so this is
the most reasonable value that typically works, unless the
device is more limited, or you want the extra performance you
get on devices that actually support a bigger mask.

If dma_set_mask() succeeds when passed a 64-bit mask, the driver
can pass high addresses into dma_map_*() and put the result into
the 64-bit DMA registers of the device. That is all the driver
needs to know here.

When the bus is more limited than the device, we either have
an swiotlb/iommu that will use bounce buffers to map dma_map_* work
anyway (using low DMA addresses for high memory), or we don't have
an swiotlb and the dma_set_mask() operation has to fail.
