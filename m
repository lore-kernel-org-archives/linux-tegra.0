In order to solve this, how about adding a backlight notifier call chain to 
broadcast backlight events in a fashion similar to what is done in 
fbmem/fbcon? Then backlight_update_status() could send events like 
BACKLIGHT_EARLY_EVENT_UPDATE and BACKLIGHT_EVENT_UPDATE to which panel drivers 
could subscribe in order to power the backlight up and down as needed.

Then as the backlight is mentioned in the panel's DT node,

>               backlight = <&backlight>;
>               ...
>       };

the panel's driver could listen to backlight-related events and do its stuff 
transparently, without changing anything to the backlight drivers. This would 
be a good way to replace pwm-backlight's callbacks for platforms that use the 
DT, and would also be applicable to any backlight class device.

Generally speaking, having a mean to monitor backlights state in the kernel 
does not seem too crazy, especially since we already have a way to notify user 
space through backlight_generate_event().

Richard, does that sound ok to you?

Alex.
