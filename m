Yes you would and so in that case it would appear to be suboptimal, I
agree. One option would be to name the new PM domain after its parents
and then see if any PM domains exist that matches the name and verify it
has the required parents. We could even add a prefix to the name to
indicate that this is a PM domain added by the core. Only problem is we
could get some long names!

Glad to see others could benefit from this ...
