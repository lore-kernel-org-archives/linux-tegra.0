Is it possible to have a "firmware" device-tree node specifically for cpufreq driver? Something like this:

cpufreq {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-cpufreq";
	clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_PLL_X>,
		 <&tegra_car TEGRA20_CLK_PLL_P>;
	clock-names = "pll_x", "intermediate";
};

We may also need a Tegra-specific DVFS helper-driver that will help to manage CPU-CORE voltage dependency. Yet I'll have to examine this all in more details, but maybe it will be nicer if DVFS could be instantiated via device-tree as well. It will provide a Tegra-specific DVFS API and manage CORE / RTC dependencies for the CPUFreq and peripheral drivers, also helping to maintain proper voltages during kernel boot-up until all drivers are brought into action.

cpufreq {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-dvfs";
	cpu-supply = <&cpu_vdd_reg>;
	core-supply = <&core_vdd_reg>;
	rtc-supply = <&rtc_vdd_reg>;
};

So my question is:

Is it possible to have device-tree nodes that solely describe firmware? Kernel drivers in this case.
