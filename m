If probe() doesn't attempt to validate that the/a DMA channel provider
exists, then there's no guarantee that the DMA provider has probed
before the DMA client driver either probes or executes any later code.
So, you could quite easily end up with a situation where the serial
driver's open fails because the DMA provider has not yet probed. This is
exactly what deferred probe was intended to avoid. This reason alone is
enough to make it worth fixing this.

probe() could validate that the provider exists in a way that doesn't
permanently hold ownership of the DMA channel. For example, request it
then immediately release it, in the absence of a dedicated "validate my
DMA providers exist" API.

That sounds like a bug. If a DMA channel /is/ specified, it should be
possible to acquire it. If no DMA channel is specified, and if the
device can do PIO, then it's reasonable to continue.
