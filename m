The client can only translate an ERR value to NULL if it knows that the
API will never return NULL. If the API could return NULL, then this
translation uses a valid return value to represent the error case.
Functions that return an ERR value or a valid value do NOT in general
say anything either way about a return value of NULL.

While this translation isn't *exactly* the same as an API returning 3
states, it is almost identical; the translation is only possible if the
set of numerically possible return values from the function are
segmented into 3 sets:

a) Valid
b) An ERR value
c) NULL (which is never returned)

I believe the important point in Russell's argument against
IS_ERR_OR_NULL is that the segmentation should be limited to two sets
(a, b) or (a, c) and not 3. I don't /think/ it was relevant whether the
function segmented the return values into 3 sets just so it could
guarantee that it didn't return one of those sets.

If that's not the case, the following would indeed solve the problem easily:

It's the combination of the two. IS_ERR_OR_NULL is two separate tests in
one macro. Simply separating the two tests into separate lines of code
doesn't change what the code is doing.

I was of course assuming that the auditing would be done, and indeed
when I first started work on this conversion, it's exactly what I was
doing. That's why I said *all* checks, not just "the first check".

No, it's a bug because if dma_request_slave_channel() is documented to
return valid-or-ERR, then assuming that it can never return NULL is
inconsistent with that. The translation is only possible if it's
documented to return valid-or-ERR-but-never-NULL.
