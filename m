I was trying to figure out how to describe the different kinds of
transformation we could have on the address/ID input to the IOMMU.
Treating the whole thing as opaque gets us off the hook there.

IDs are probably not propagated, not remapped, or we simply don't care
about them; whereas the address transformation is software-controlled,
so we don't describe that anyway.

Delegating grokking the mapping to the iommu driver makes sense --
it's what it's there for, after all.


I'm not sure whether the windowed IOMMU case is special actually.

Since the address to program into the master is found by calling the
IOMMU driver to create some mappings, does anything except the IOMMU
driver need to understand that there is windowing?

Just for clarification, "reg" just has its standard meaning here, and
is nothing to do with the IOMMU?

In effect, "iommus" is doing the same thing as my "slaves" property.

The way #address-cells and #size-cells determine the address and range
size for mastering into the IOMMU is also similar.  The main difference
is that I didn't build the ID into the address.

How do we know the size of the input address to the IOMMU?  Do we
get cases for example where the IOMMU only accepts a 32-bit input
address, but some 64-bit capable masters are connected through it?

The size of the output address from the IOMMU will be determined
by its own mastering destination, which by default in ePAPR is the
IOMMU node's parent.  I think that's what you intended, and what we
expect in this case.

For determining dma masks, it is the output address that it
important.  Santosh's code can probably be taught to handle this,
if given an additional traversal rule for following "iommus"
properties.  However, deploying an IOMMU whose output address size
is smaller than the

I think multi-master is the common case.

This sounds just right.  The required semantics is that the presence of
"iommus" on some bus mastering device overrides the ePAPR default
destination so that transactions are delivered to the IOMMU for
translation instead of the master's DT parent node.

Where transactions flow out of the IOMMU, the iommu takes on the role
of the master, so the default destination would be the iommu node's
parent.

I think it would be inconsistent and unnecessary to disallow it in the
binding.  The meaning you've proposed seems completely consistent with
ePAPR, so I suggest to keep it.  The IOMMU is just another bus master
from the ePAPR point of view -- no need to make special rules for it
unless they are useful.

The binding does not need to be (and generally shouldn't be) a
description of precisely what the kernel does and does not support.

However, if we don't need to support non-identity dma-ranges in Linux
yet, we have the option to barf if we see such a dma-ranges memorywards
of an IOMMU, if it simplifies the Linux implementation.  We could always
relax that later -- and it'll be obvious how to describe that situation
in DT.



What I would like to see is a recommandation, based on Thierry's binding
here, for describing how cross-mastering in general is described.  It's
not really a binding, but more of a template for bindings.

I'm happy to have a go at writing it, then we can decide whether it's
useful or not.


There are a few things from the discussion that are *not* solved by this
iommu binding, but they seem reasonable.  The binding also doesn't block
solving those things later if/when needed:

 1) Cross-mastering to things that are not IOMMUs

    We might need to solve this later if we encounter SoCs with
    problematic topologies, we shouldn't worry about it for the time
    being.

    We'll to revisit it for GICv3 but that's a separate topic.

 2) Describing address and ID remappings for cross-mastering.

    We can describe this in a way that is consistent with this IOMMU
    binding.  We will need to describe something for GICv3, but the
    common case will be that IDs are just passed through without
    remapping.

    We don't need to clarify how IDs are propagated until we have
    something in DT for IDs to propagate to.
