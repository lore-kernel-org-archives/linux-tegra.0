What I meant is, it might not worth to move request channel to probe
only because we need to check error and return -EPROBE_DEFER.

dma_request_slave_channel is better to be called as late as possible to
make better dynamic use of dma channels.

Actually, I searched the kernel code, most drivers don't return EPROBE_DEFER
when dma_request_slave_channel failed. dma_request_slave_channel can
fail in many cases, and dma device not probed is only one case.

Thanks
