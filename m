Arnd Bergmann raised this issue previously[1], but I assumed it would 
only happen on some obscure configuration, as clearly arm 
tegra_defconfig and multi_v7_defconfig and arm64 defconfig are building.

It would be interesting to know how this is being triggered here.

Of course the code is here is not very desirable - the root issue is 
that we want to allocate writecombine physical memory but there is no 
API to do that, so we rely on the DMA API "accidentally" doing the right 
thing.
