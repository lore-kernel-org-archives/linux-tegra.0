Yep, will send a separate patch for this.

I would like to keep everything that is defined by the COM to reside in
the COM dtsi. You are right that the regulator in this case is board
specific and should be moved to the board file, I missed this while
splitting things out. But at least the GPIO is defined by the fixed COM
pinout.

Might be a nice cleanup.

I don't really see the benefit of merging those nodes. They are separate
regulators, some are located on the COM, others on the carrier board. So
I would like to keep them in separate nodes, unless you have strong
feelings to change this.
