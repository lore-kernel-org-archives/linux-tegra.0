That file doesn't exist at this point in the series. I think you should
create a patch up-front that adds that header, and modifies the binding
document, all in one go, and separate from any driver code changes.
Separate DT/driver patches were IIRC agreed to be preferablte at the
recent ARM workshop.

I'm afraid I still don't quite understand what a swgroup is.

IIUC, the HW works like this based on comments in a previous patch:

Each bus-master attached to the MMU passes a "memory client ID" along
with the transaction. Some devices can generate transactions with
different "memory client IDs". There is a mapping inside the SMMU from
"memory client ID" to "address space ID". (I don't know what form that
mapping takes; can you point out where it's set up?). Each "address
space ID" has its own set of page tables. Is "swgroup" simply another
name for "memory client ID"? If so, it'd be good to use just one term
consistently.

Assuming "swgroup" is "memory client ID", why can't the driver just
create a list/... of known swgroups at runtime, based on the swgroup
values that each device uses, which would presumably be either
hard-coded in the client device's driver, or represented in the DT smmu
property's "iommu specifier" value.

I must admit to having zero idea what that part of the patch is doing
semantically. Some form of explanation in the commit description would
be useful.
