Given that you're the second one to report breakage, I think it's probably
better if I drop the mach-types update from my 'fixes' branch, and punt
it into the stuff for the next merge window.

That means that the PXA stuff which was inappropriately merged without
its mach-type entry will stay broken until after the next merge window.
Unfortunate, but I'm not seeing much other option other than me having
to put lots of time into manually sorting out a mach-types update (which
I don't have the time nor motivation to do at the moment.)
