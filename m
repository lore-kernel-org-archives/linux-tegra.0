That could be OK with me. If I can get the magic blessing from the DT
folks, then I'll send patches to update everything.

It's not SFDP. We're looking at SPI flash that are detected simply by
the READ ID (9Fh) opcode. SFDP is on newer SPI flash which support the
5Ah opcode, for reading a parameter table. (I'd like to support this
soon, actually, and one of those sorts of strings might work.)
