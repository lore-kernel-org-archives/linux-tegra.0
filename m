I've hoped so, that's why I've written it.

I've just tried to describe the facts in order to make the problem space 
more clear, because, as said, I don't think it's convoluted.

Besides that, I didn't want to suggest anything else other than what 
I've already posted working patches for. What I've mentioned as possible 
other solutions above is stuff which might be possible too in order to 
give some starting points for people which are searching another 
solution. But I wouldn't have written my patches as they are, if I would 
think there is another more easier solution.

And of course, there is still a bit to resolve at runtime, even in the 
DT case (look at the "compatible" attribute). But there is already a 
runtime solution to find the right driver (in case of DT) and I haven't 
mentioned it in order to no confuse people again. Mentioning every 
little detail doesn't make sense if you want to describe something 
understandable (which is what I've tried).

You just need one working ordered sequence which includes all options. 
This one will work for all others too.

Totally wrong. If you assume that I assume this, than either I was 
totally unable to describe something clearly, or you were unable or 
unwilling to understand what I've written. And as the result is the 
same, we don't need to find out which was reason.

Anyway, have fun. I'm quitting the discussion here as I don't have any 
business with the kernel and already decided some time again to not post 
patches anymore as it seems to be a waste of my (and maybe others) time.
