It seems to me that if mbox_send_message() is called from an atomic
context AND tx_block is true, then if 'flush' is not populated this
should be an error condition as we do not wish to call
wait_for_completion from an atomic context.

I understand that there is some debate about adding such flush support,
but irrespective of the above change, it seems to me that if the
mbox_send_message() can be called from an atomic context (which it
appears to), then it should be detecting if someone is trying to do so
with 'tx_block' set as this should be an error.

Furthermore, if the underlying mailbox driver can support sending a
message from an atomic context and busy wait until it is done, surely
the mailbox framework should provide a means to support this?

Now it could be possible for the underlying mailbox driver to detect we
are in an atomic context and if the 'tx_block' is set do the right thing
by busy waiting until the message is sent. However, the problem with
that is, that for the mbox_send_message() to ensure the right thing is
done, it needs to check that 'tx_done' is set in the case of a blocking
transfer in an atomic context. At that point you may as well add the
flush operator as I think it is more implicit/clear.

Cheers
Jon
