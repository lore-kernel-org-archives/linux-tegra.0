Ah, got it.

I wouldn't worry about it at the moment, the read_persistent_clock64
interface is very rarely used: only arm, ia64, mips/lasat and s390
define it at all, only arm has more than one implementation (omap
and tegra) and the tegra, ia64 and mips implementations should really
use timekeeping_inject_sleeptime64() instead.

read_boot_clock64() is even rarer: only s390 defines it, apparently
because it is the only architecture that uses a single register for
wall-clock time and high-resolution time (it has a 96-bit
quarternanosecond register that is synchronized before booting Linux).	

TEGRA folks: the tegra_read_persistent_clock() implementation apparently
predates the Tegra RTC driver and I wonder if they actually do the
right thing in combination. Could it be that the wall time forwards
twice as fast as it should during resume when the RTC driver is loaded?
Could it be that we can simply remove  tegra_read_persistent_clock()
and the register_persistent_clock() infrastructure?
