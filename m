Yup, I'm well aware of all that; in fact you and I have already agreed 
elsewhere that we can only really get away with using the streaming DMA 
API to flush IOMMU page table updates _because_ they aren't written back 
to, thus data only ever goes from CPU->IOMMU and we can skip the problem 
of where to put an invalidation; you wrote the tegra-smmu code that does 
this. The coherency of whatever device which made a DMA API call for 
which the IOMMU API is creating/removing a mapping is irrelevant at this 
point - this is the DMA operation within the DMA operation.

None of which has anything to do with the point I raised, which is that 
if iommu_unmap() calls iommu_flush(), I want to issue TLB invalidations, 
but if iommu_map() calls iommu_flush(), I don't.
