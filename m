On Whistler using next-20120705, that did help a bit; the board actually
boots to the login prompt in the usual amount of time rather than
hanging before even detecting the root filesystem.

However, there is obviously still some problem with I2C accesses, since
neither the pca953x nor wm8753 drivers are able to communicate with
their devices.

Re: the DT-vs-non-DT differences, it's most likely because only parts of
the clock initialization table are common (in common.c) and parts are in
board-${boardname}.c (for non-DT) or board-dt-tegra*.c (for DT). I'm
looking forward to when we can just put all the clock setup in the
board-specific .dts files:-)

I'll investigate more later (where most later might mostly be in 2 weeks
after I return from vacation)
