Ah, so you mean keep the options in mach-tegra/Kconfig so that there's
a single place to configure per-SoC support, but just ignore those
options in code (like the Tegra CPU reset vector) where it's not worth
it. That sounds reasonable.

The one remaining issue is that we have plenty of HW module whose
driver works across multiple HW generations. For example,
tegra20_i2s.c supports only Tegra20, yet tegra30_i2s.c supports both
Tegra30 and Tegra114, and likely will support other generations too.
The key to enable tegra30_i2s.c should really be ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC ||
ARCH_TEGRA_114_SOC, which gets a bit unwieldy once you have, say, 4
different SoCs in that list and a similar list starts to apply to a
lot of different HW-modules/drivers. Even creating an
ARCH_TEGRA_30_OR_LATER_SOC will get problematic, since defining "or
later" will likely become progressively more complex over time, as we
start putting our more SoCs. What are your thoughts on the best way to
solve that?
