Thanks for the pointer!

Yes, Tegra has SDHCI_QUIRK_DATA_TIMEOUT_USES_SDCLK set, and has a max
clock of 208MHz specified in HW, yet we only run the HW at 48MHz
upstream, since we haven't actually implemented any of the
advanced/faster transfer rates yet. Hence that patch does avoid/solve
the issue on 2 of my boards.

However, the patch doesn't solve the problem on 2 other boards, since
the eMMC device on those boards specifies a much larger timeout, which
still causes max_discard to be set to 0. It sounds like the real
solution is what was discussed elsewhere in this thread; to use command
polling for erases?

Even on the boards where your patch solves the problem, isn't it just a
temporary measure; as soon as we upstream the changes to enable the
faster transfer modes, we'll have a faster SDCLK, and hence again be
limited in the discard size, perhaps down to a single sector again.

(Incidentally, I think the code should be limiting to a single erase
block, not a single sector. I'll send a separate patch to fix that, and
Cc everyone here).
