I don't think everybody is following this rule, patches go to the SoC
maintainer's tree without sometimes going through lakml.

=46urthermore, there is not only ARM, there is also acpi_idle, intel_id=
le,
pseries_idle and sh_idle, respectively located in:

drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c
drivers/acpi/processor_driver.c
drivers/idle/intel_idle.c

These ones above are under linux-pm, that is Rafael, like cpuidle, even
if it is not marked in the MAINTAINERS file, so that should be ok.

And there is also:

arch/sh/kernel/cpu/shmobile/cpuidle.c
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/processor_idle.c

And hopefully, some others in the right place, calxeda_idle and
kirwood_idle located in drivers/cpuidle.

In the maintainer file, there is no information about cpuidle at all.

=46or example, if someone modify the cpuidle framework allowing to
consolidate the code across the different drivers, we have to wait for
the merge before using the new api into the different drivers.
If we follow strictly the path of the merge tree we fall into a scenari=
o
where consolidating the drivers takes a loooooong time.

=46rom my POV, *all* the cpuidle drivers must go under drivers/cpuidle,
like cpufreq and pass through a single entry point to apply the patches=
,
so the cpuidle framework and the drivers are always synced.

If everyone agree and we reach this consensus, then we can work to move
these drivers to a single place.

I think Amit was suggesting to Cc me in the meantime, so while we are
moving these drivers to this place, I can help to ensure we go to the
same direction.

=46or example, Arnd Cc'ed me about the zynq cpuidle driver when it has
been posted and, after review, it appeared it was totally obsolete wrt
the modifications we did this year.

I propose first to add an entry in MAINTAINERS:

diff --git a/MAINTAINERS b/MAINTAINERS

Does it make sense ?
