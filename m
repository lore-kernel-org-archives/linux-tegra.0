[V3] : This patch series version includes
	- only patches that are not applied from V2.
	- splitted expanding mode and adding LSByte First support
	  in separate patches and removed DT property for selecting
	  LSByte First.
	- Updated GPIO based chip select control to use spi_set_cs
	  from SPI core.
	- HW based chip select implementation is same as V2 but V3
	  has this patch updated to be on top of above changes.
	- HW CS timing implementation is same as V2 but V3
	  has this patch updated to be on top of above changes.
	- support for TX and RX trimmers implementation is same as V2
	  but V3 has this patch updated to be on top of above changes
	  and updated commit description.

[V2] : This patch series version includes
	- only patches that are not applied from V1.
	- changed order of patches to include all fixes prior to new features
	  support.
	- Removed HW CS timing from DT properties and created set_cs_timing
	  SPI master optional method for SPI controllers to implement and
	  created API spi_cs_timing for SPI client drivers to request CS
	  setup, hold and inactive delay timing configuration.
	- Fixed HW based CS decision to be based on single transfer and
	  cs_change. Remove selection of HW based CS through DT.
