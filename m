This is directly related to that problem, see below.

This *is* for hardware. I can use PCI as an example, but this could equally
apply to other types of bus. If you have a bunch of PCI master devices
sitting being a non-transparent bridge, they can end up sharing the same
master device ID (requester ID). This means that there is no way in the
IOMMU to initialise a translation for one of these devices without also
affecting the others. We currently have iommu_groups to deal with this, but
it *is* a property of the hardware and we absolutely need a way to describe
it. I'm happy to add it later, but we need to think about it now to avoid
merging something that can't easily be extended.

For PCI, the topology is probable but even then, we need this information to
describe the resulting master device ID emitted by the bridge for the
upstream group. One way to do this with your binding would be to treat all
of the upstream masters as having the same device ID.

With virtualisation, we may want to assign a group of devices to a guest but
without emulating the bridge. This would need something the device-tree to
describe that they are grouped together.

That sounds more like a software decision, which I agree doesn't need to be
described.
