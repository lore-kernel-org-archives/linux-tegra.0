Hello,

I tried to utilize the Tegra devfreq driver on Tegra30 and found out that
it doesn't work properly due to improper Hz<->kHz conversions made by the
driver. After fixing that problem and doing some more testing I noticed
that there are things that could be improved and in result here is this
patchset that fixes the problems, makes some improvements and adds support
for NVIDIA Tegra30 SoC's. This series was tested on Tegra30 and Tegra124
machines.

This series also adds support for the Tegra20 SoC's that do not have
the ACTMON hardware unit, but can use Memory Controller counters to make
decision about the required memory frequency. Please note that the patch
that instantiates a platform device for the driver isn't a part of this
series, I'll submit it later on because of interdependency with some other
ongoing patchset.

Please review, thanks.

Changelog:

v2: The patchset was quite heavily reworked since v1, few patches we
    dropped or squashed into the new ones and more patches we added.
    In a result more bugs and potential problems are fixed now, driver's
    code got more clean up.

    The Tegra20 driver-addition patch is now a part of this series, it has
    no changes since v1.
