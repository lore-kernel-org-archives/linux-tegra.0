This series introduces a way to use pwm-backlight hooks with platforms
that use the device tree through a subdriver system. It also adds support
for the Tegra-based Ventana board, adding the last missing block to enable
its panel. Support for other Tegra board can thus be easily added.

I have something else in mind to properly support this (power
sequences), but this work relies on the GPIO subsystem redesign which will
take some time. The pwm-backlight subdrivers can do the job by the meantime.

There are a few design points that might need to be discussed:
1) Link order is important: subdrivers register themselves in their
module_init function, which must be called before pwm-backlight's probe.
This forbids linking subdrivers as separate modules from pwm-backlight.
2) The subdriver's data is temporarily passed through the backlight
device's driver data. This should not hurt, but maybe there is a better way
to do this.
3) Subdrivers must add themselves into pwm-backlight's own of_device_id
table. It would be cleaner to not have to list subdrivers into
pwm-backlight's main file, but I cannot think of a way to do otherwise.

Suggestions for the 3 points listed above are very welcome - in any case,
I hope to make this converge into something mergeable quickly.

Note that these patches are the last missing block to get a functional
panel on Tegra boards. Using 3.8rc4 and these patches, the internal panel
on Ventana is usable out-of-the-box. Yay.
