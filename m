Sounds to me like the warning is justified - it's saying that there's
something not right here which could be a problem.  So I'd say, don't
fix the warning, it's doing its job, highlighting a potential problem
with the code.

(Consider hiding the warning and then running on a platform where the
assumptions are broken.)
