My assertion was incorrect.  A probe in the deferral processing can
result in the driver being placed on the new deferred list, then when
a later probe of another deferred driver succeeds, the first driver
will be moved to the active deferred list, and might succeed on
the second probe attempt (or with the current messages would result
in a second set of deferred messages).  So yes, placing
"driver_deferred_probe_report = true" where your patch put it and
running through the deferred probe processing again is correct.
