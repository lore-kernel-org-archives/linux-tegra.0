Hi all,

I'm not sure what your exact plans are for the direction in which the
DRM driver should head, as I'm still a bit out of the loop as many of
those matters were only discussed internally at NVIDIA or with some NDA
developers. But I'll still try to get into the discussion.

In my understanding carveout is neither a hardware nor software
component. It's just a somewhat special pool of memory. As I pointed out
in one of the older mails, carveout can not completely replace GART.
While normal allocations for graphics use should be done contiguous,
GART allows us to link normal scattered sysram buffers into GPU address
space, which is a nice thing to have.
IMHO if carveout is to be used exclusively by the GPU (i.e. the DRM
driver) it should be a property of the host1x device.

I think this is the wrong way to go. Having a special memory pool
managed by some driver adds one more allocator to the kernel, which is
clearly not desirable. If we want a special mem region for GPU use, we
should not share this memory pool with other components.

But if we want a mem region for contig allocations used by many
components, which seems to be consensus here, CMA is the way to go. In
this case I think we don't want to bother with the carveout property at
all at the DRM driver level. Such a shared mem region managed by CMA
should be defined at a higher level of the device tree.

Thanks,
Lucas
