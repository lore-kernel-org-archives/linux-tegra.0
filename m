Oh, you didn't know that gpiod_set_value/gpiod_get_value takes care of
active high/low automatically. That explains the disconnect.

If I have this in my device tree:

bq24735-charger@9{
	compatible = "ti,bq24735";
	ti,ac-detect-gpios = <&ioexp 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};

and do
	gpiod_get(dev, "ti,ac-detect", GPIOD_IN);

then gpiod_get_value() on that gpio descriptor will return 1 (as in
active) when the signal is low.

You have to use gpiod_get_raw_value to see what's on the actual line.
But that is almost always not interesting, the reasons for that should
be obvious from this discussion...

So, I lie and say GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW so that gpiod_get_value returns 0 when
AC is there (signal is high), and the driver inverts that and gets that
AC is present and starts charging.

Cheers,
