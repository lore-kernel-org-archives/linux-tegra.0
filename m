It's an optimization to reduce resource usage in the IOMMU, but one that
is *required* by certain platforms (e.g. Olav mentioned his 43-ID master
and Calxeda had something similar).

Basically, in order to perform an ->attach() for a master to a domain, we
need complete knowledge of the system so that we can avoid accidentally
attaching other masters to the same domain. The programming is done using
a form of StreamID wildcarding, so at this point we would need to have
parsed the entire DT to ensure our wildcard doesn't match other masters.

We could do that only if we were guaranteed to have an ->add() call for
*every* master before an ->attach() call for *any* master. I don't think
that is necessarily true.

Why not? If we're simply searching for phandles to the IOMMU, why does it
matter whether a driver is bound to the master?

See above, they are all required the moment anybody tries an ->attach().

Yes, we need a way to associate an IOMMU with a bus instance, but I think
that's a separate topic, no?
