=46unnily enough, that's not actually true (and is more or less what pr=

this patch after discussion with Russell). There are cores out there th=

don't predict mov pc, lr at all (let alone do anything with the return
stack).

I'm led to believe that some predictors require lr in order to update t=
he
return stack, whilst others don't. That part is all horribly
micro-architectural, so the current patch is doing the right thing by
sticking to the ARM ARM but enabling us to hook into other registers la=
ter
on if we choose.

Cheers,
