The only compile-time dependencies here should be that:
- patch 8 of 9 which contains the actual driver depends on patch 6 of 9 
(though only when building as a module) and the efuse series
- patch 2 of 9 refers to the DT node called "padctl", so it requires the 
xusb series. (in the submitted xusb series, the node isn't actually 
named, though. I will fix this in v2)
