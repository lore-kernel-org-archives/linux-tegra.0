That looks a bit cumbersome to me.

Power (and clock) domains are platform features.  Any IP core may show up
in a new SoC, and suddenly have become part of one or more PM Domains.
Having to handle that in each individual driver will cause lots of churn.
Especially as the multiple PM Domains a device may belong to may be
fairly orthogonal to each other.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
