I believe the assumption today is that all bus numbers are ok on each
root port, which is usually the case. There was something about a Power
Mac that faked a single PCI bus number space across both an AGP and
a PCIe domain in pmac_pci_fixup_u4_of_node(), but I think that is the
exception.

Is there any requirement to use a bus aperture on non-PC hardware?

If the default is allowing any bus numbers, and that matches the
hardware capabilities, I think hot-plugging would work.
