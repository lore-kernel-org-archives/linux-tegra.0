Yes.  This enables the ARM PMU driver for the Cortex A15, which allows
one to use hardware performance counters via the perf_event_open API.
For a simple test program, see
https://github.com/khuey/perf-counter-test/.  Without this patch, the
perf_event_open syscall will fail.  With this patch, the program will
print out the performance counter value for each iteration of the
loop. (IIRC on the A15 the branch counter was removed, so you may want
to replace 0xD with 0x8 which counts instructions executed if you want
to see a non-zero number there).  You also will see a message about
the PMU in the kernel log at startup after applying this patch.

I have also tested this extensively (including the interrupt features
of the PMU) on a more complex program.

> Does it enable using perf for profiling?

I have not tested it, but I believe you can use perf without this
patch if you do not use features that require hardware performance
counter support.  This patch would enable those features.

I have no objections.  I was not aware that the device tree syntax
supported that.  FWIW I cargo-culted my way to victory from
vexpress-v2p-ca9.dts here.
