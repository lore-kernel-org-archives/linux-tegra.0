This series defines a common way for devicetree initialized
power_supplies to define their relationships between chargers and
supplicants.

This series adds a supplied_from array to complement the supplied_to
array and to allow supplies to define the list of supplies which
supply them.

Then once this property is supported, we can use a new property for
devicetree to define the relationships between nodes, and read in this
property to generate the supplied_from list.

With this logic in place, all drivers need to do to add support for
this mechanism, is to store their device tree node in the power_supply
struct. They should also handle EPROBE_DEFER properly.

Changes since:
RFC v2:
 - Changed to official Patch set rather than RFC
 - defined supplied_from char ** array rather than complicated
   struct device_node related array

RFC v1:
 - Inverted the logic so that supplies (batteries) contain a list of
   the supplies (chargers) which supply them.

Rhyland Klein (3):
  power_supply: Define Binding for power-supplies
  power: power_supply: Add core support for supplied_from
  power: power_supply_core: Add support for supplied_from
