Well, the big question which needs answering is whether this AHB software
interface is something specific to Tegra or whether it really is something
generic.  There's been some hints in the previous thread that it's
specific to Tegra, so it may not after all make sense for it to be a
generic driver.

However, we _have_ decided "no more drivers under arch/arm".  So I really
don't want to see "struct xxx_driver" appearing in any code under that
subdirectory or one of its decendents.  I don't have much more to say
about location than that.
