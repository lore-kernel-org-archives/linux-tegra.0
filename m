How about changing ->determine_rate() and ->round_rate() prototypes so
that they always return 0 or an error code and passing the adjusted_rate
as an argument ?

Something like that:

	int (*round_rate)(struct clk_hw *hw, unsigned long *rate,
			  unsigned long *parent_rate);
	int (*determine_rate)(struct clk_hw *hw, unsigned long *rate,
			      unsigned long min_rate,
			      unsigned long max_rate,
			      unsigned long *best_parent_rate,
			      struct clk_hw **best_parent_hw);

I know this implies a lot of changes (in all clock drivers and in the
core infrastructure), but I really think we should not mix error codes
and clock frequencies (even if we decide to move to a 64 bits rate
approach).

Anyway, IMHO the only alternative to this solution is solution #3,
because #1 implies re-introducing another bug where
->round_rate()/->determine_rate() are silently ignored, and #2 implies
lying about your DFLL capabilities.

Mike, what's your opinion ?

Best Regards,

Boris
