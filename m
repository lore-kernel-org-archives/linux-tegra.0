I was imagining that the root was correct, but a particular device was
wrong. A typo in the root is also a possibility.

Even if review is perfect in-tree, people are going to use out-of-tree
DTBs to some extent, and I'm not sure we can argue that's an entirely
wrong thing to do. So review may not help.

The line here is extremely fuzzy; I don't know what we can class as 
"clearly broken".

I agree that we will accumulate legacy no matter how careful we are.

I would like to ensure that we avoid as much of that as possible. For
cases like these where the DTB has insufficient information, we can
avoid those for now by requiring the information to be in the DT and
doing nothing otherwise -- there's no legacy DT to support yet.

I can imagine that we may need to add workarounds of this sort in
future, and I'd like to ensure they are precisely targeted (e.g. have
needs_missing_dt_pmc rather than soc_is_tegra, and ideally warning).

I'm hoping that by being as explicit as possible now in the DT (e.g.
requiring enable-method), we can allow for future variation and not get
stuck in painful corners w.r.t. wide-reaching assumptions in platform
code. I'm also hoping that this will make sharing DTs with other
software more feasible, as it won't be necessary to make identical
assumptions regarding the platform.

Exactly what I was hoping to hear :)

Thanks,
