Well, there are two aspects:

a) Can the pin controller do it, which is something per-SoC/driver?
b) Does it make sense for the board, given what each pin is connected to?

So unless we decide to ignore (b) (which may be perfectly fine but as I
mentioned I'd just like to explicitly decide this), there needs to be some
per-SoC way of representing this capability, /and/ some per-board way.

The pins are part of the pin group in HW. It doesn't make sense to say
that they aren't, and indeed the SoC driver has no board knowledge and
couldn't exclude them anyway.
