So there are two paths through the tegra_uart_dma_channel_allocate()
function, one for RX and one for TX. In the RX case, a buffer is
allocated via dma_alloc_coherent() and if this fails, then we simply
call dma_release_channel(). So there should not be any memory leaked in
this path and we should not need to worry about dma_buf/dma_phys here.

In the TX case, the xmit.buf (allocated by the serial_core driver) is
mapped to physical space for DMA. If the mapping fails, the xmit.buf is
not freed here and we simply call dma_release_channel().

If you are concerned about the xmit.buf, then this is part serial core
and allocated when uart_open() is called. It uart_open() fails, because
the tegra_uart_dma_channel_allocate() fails, then uart_close() will be
called (according the to kernel-doc for uart_open) and should be freed
when uart_shutdown() is called. So I don't see a problem here.

Let me know if I am misunderstanding you.

Ok.
