So, a device can generate transactions using n different IDs, yet those
IDs all fit into some specific number of bits if represented as a
bitmask rather than a list. The size of that bitmask would be a good
candidate for #iommu-cells.

So yes, that seems like a reasonable representation.

dtc now supports math expressions. You need to wrap expressions in ()
for them to be recognized, so if you write the above as:

	       iommu = <&smmu (SWGROUP_ID_A | SWGROUP_ID_B)>;

... it should work fine.

The problem with that is that it doesn't allow for multiple IOMMUs to be
represented by one property. You need a fixed number (e.g. #iommu-cells)
of cells after the phandle in order to know where one IOMMU specifier
ends, and the next phandle/specifier starts. While multiple IOMMUs is
likely quite rare, I see no reason to force a lack of support for that
scenario by ignoring the standard phandle/fixed-length-specifier
property format.

I think this should be done explicitly in drivers. It's much simpler,
and doesn't encode any knowledge of driver-specific bindings into some
common bus notifier code.
