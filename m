We introduced oob interrupt support in 3.5 [1]. We are using a virtual 
platform device to retrieve board specific oob interrupt GPIO setting. 
You should be able to implement the power control in this way as well. 
Brcmfmac gets the GPIOs through platform device interface, powers up the 
chip and triggers a card detection. Then 4329 should be enumerated by 
MMC stack. The reason we didn't implement this is the card detection. 
Some design doesn't have hardware card detection since the WiFi chip is 
already on board. And the current MMC stack doesn't have virtual card 
detection interface.
