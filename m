The DT /cpu bindings provide the kernel with a list of MPIDR ("reg"
property) of all CPUs in the system. What I wanted to say is that, you
can probe in HW the number of cores in some situations, but the DT
provides more information than that, so I was debating the "duplicating
stuff that can be runtime probed" point.

In some platforms you can probe the number of cores in HW, but the MPIDR
of existing CPUs is "generated" in smp_setup_processor_id() (you cannot
probe the MPIDR of CPUs that are off or held in a pen), as a sequential number
and stored in the cpu_logical_map. This works well for single cluster systems,
since the MPIDR[23:0] of processors in a single cluster system is a sequential
number starting from 0 (well, at least MPIDR[7:0], but let's not get bogged
down into details).

For multi-cluster systems this fails, and DT comes to the rescue along
with its companion parsing function, arm_dt_init_cpu_maps().

The long and short of it is: DT /cpu nodes are not there just for number
of cores counting, but there is more. Probably on Tegra this is not
needed at the moment, but this provides the groundwork for a generic and
solid solution for all upcoming ARM platforms.

I hope this helps, let me know if it is not clear.
