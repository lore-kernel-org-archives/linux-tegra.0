That sounds familiar and that's exactly the problem, and that's a problem
that won't disappear by just moving code around directories (hey, it is
not that we have not tried =)), as you (and I) know very well:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/8/16/399
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-August/190067.html

Either a common way of dealing with this early CPU bring-up code is
implemented (but it can't be platform specific otherwise we are back to
square one) or we decide that this code does not belong in the kernel and
should be abstracted away.

And I think that most of the early bring up issues are just related to
powering-up/resetting a cpu for it to be booted, probably that's the
abstraction we should be focusing on, because it should just require poking
a bunch of registers to kickstart a CPU, no more than that, FW should be
able to deal with that and that's yet another reason behind PSCI design.

I am not convinced that the early device model would be useful for any
other reason, that's why shoehorning kernel changes in the current driver
model just to bring up secondaries is not something I consider useful
and proper, in the first place, but I am happy to hear other possible
concerns.
