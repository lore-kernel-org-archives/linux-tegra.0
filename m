Will, Joseph's thoughts above pretty much match mine re: kexec. In the
kexec thread I started earlier, I talked about replacing:

void machine_shutdown(void)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	smp_send_stop();
#endif
}

with something like:

void machine_shutdown(void)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
 	disable_nonboot_cpus();
#elifdef CONFIG_SMP
	smp_send_stop();
#endif
}

and you'd responded "I think you're better off using what we currently
have and hanging your code off platform_cpu_kill.".

What exactly did you mean by "what we currently have"; did you mean that
cpu_kill() should work without cpu_die() having executed on the target
CPU itself first, so Tegra should simply implement cpu_kill()? As Joseph
says above, I'm not sure that will work. Any more detailed thoughts you
have here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
