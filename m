Yes, I agree.

What I am seeing is that there continues to be a need for the ability
to explicitly order at least some driver initialization (at some
granularity), despite the push back against explicit ordering that
has been present in the past.

Yep, it is not directly ad hoc, just a fortunate side effect in
this case.  So just accidently ad hoc. :-)
