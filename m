Why not? We'll always have some amount of board code. The key is to
limit parts that are just data. I'm not sure this is something that
should be in devicetree.

Perhaps what is needed is a better way to hook into the driver like
notifiers?

Bindings need to documented in Documentation/devicetree

What do this mean? Isn't this implied for a regulator?

This looks like you designed the platform_data structs first and then
came up with device nodes to mirror the struct.
