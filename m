OK.

It's due to the long time that SDRAM leaves self-refresh. Looks
something that related to BCT not be flashed during the flashing
process. Please also check the internal bug 1314918.

We need to restore all of them for all Tegra chips. For Tegra20/30, we
had done it in the tegra_cpu_car_ops.suspend/resume. For Tegra114, the
patch was here.

The other reason is:
1) The PLLX is the main CPU clock source in Tegra20/30. We can restore
it ASAP to get a better performance.
2) For Tegra114, the PLLX is the CPU clock source when CPU runs at low
rates. When CPU in high rate, it uses DFLL as clock source. So it
depends on what the clock source of the CPU when it goes into suspend.
And the DFLL has its own resume code, it needs to be restored before the
CPU uses it as clock source again. It makes the CPU clock restore
sequence like this.

I also want to know more detail about it. The TRM only said it decided
by HW and gave an example about when switching to IRQ or FIQ state.

The code before this is the PLLX re-enable code. Then it switches to
PLLX. The rate is still kept the same when it suspended. The next rate
change after resume would be happened in the CPUfreq driver.

After the PLLs was disabled, only SCLK switched to CLK_S, the CPU and
MSELECT still keep in CLK_M. Because the CPU would be powered off
immediately.

Yes, switching them to the Oscillator before disabling the PLLs.
