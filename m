PERIPHCLK is a different thing. Here we are defining the CPU clock and
its *parent* sources, the PLLX (main) and backup (intermediate clock
that is used while PLLX changes its rate). These are not some random
clocks "that you happen to want access to", they are essential for the
Tegra CPUFreq driver, CPU is running off them.

I assume that PERIPHCLK and other clocks are derived from the "CPU"
clock and their configuration is hardwired. Probably Peter knows how
it's implemented in HW.

I'm now working on v2 that will include more Tegra-specific stuff in the
binding, like custom "opp-supported-hw" property and probably some more.
