My $0.02 is that anyone downstream picking this will also be picking
the cmd db change, so I'd suggest squashing as suggested by Quentin.
Maybe you can do that and post a v12?  Since it sounded like Greg was
about ready to land [1] maybe we shouldn't wait too long till doing
it?

...unfortunately I guess we need to figure out how this will actually
land.  Greg can't pick the series up directly since it won't compile
without the cmd-db change.  ...so we need to do one of the following:

1. Feed it through a tree that goes through arm-soc (Andy's tree or
arm-soc directly) so you'll have commit ed3cafa79ea7 ("soc: qcom:
cmd-db: Stop memcpy()ing in cmd_db_read_aux_data()").

2. Greg could also merge in Andy's pull request
(https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10710447/), but you'll get some
unrelated patches too.

3. Wait until next year and we have the next -rc1 to get this merged.

...it seems like #1 would be the least painful option, but obviously
others would have to be OK w/ it.
