I'm sorry to have this reported on a non appropriate place. I had the impression that 
the ChromeOS kernel, and especially the timer related code, doesn't differ too much 
from the mainline kernel (only suspend code added?).

On the other hand, there is no other place I know of to report problems with Android 
or ChromeOS kernels and which is reaching most of tegra kernel developers/users 
(sorry again if readers feel that I just spammed the list). There are at least some 
chances other users also see this issue, if it is not strictly related to the 
ChromeOS kernel only.

Ok, I filed a bug report: http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=25334 
(no idea how to add a CC).

I'll also try to reproduce it on a mainline kernel.
