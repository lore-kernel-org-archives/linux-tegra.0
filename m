I realized the parallel barrier helper was not included in the patch
set I posted, it will be in the next patch set.  Short version, no
caller to cpuidle_coupled_parallel_barrier will return before all cpus
in the coupled set have called it.  It allows you to resynchronize the
cpus after an abort to ensure they have all seen the abort flag before
clearing it and returning, leaving everything in the correct state for
the next idle attempt.
