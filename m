Yes, that is precisely my concern. Sorry for not stating that more clearly.

Mmm, that's something to consider. Forcing power sequences to be grouped 
within a "power-sequences" node would also make parsing easier from the 
driver side since it would not have to explicitly parse every sequence. 
We could even imagine some tighter integration with the device subsystem 
to automatically run specifically-named sequences during suspend/resume. 
But maybe I'm thinking too much here.

Let's do that then - as for the PWM issue I had, let's address that by 
clearly stating in the documentation that phandles referring to a same 
device *must* be identical.

It could if you are parsing a NULL node. It seems safe to me to consider 
that a NULL sequence is an empty sequence, but if I go for your solution 
involving another data structure to encapsulate the sequence, then this 
might change.

That is for platform data - resolved sequences get their type from their 
resource, and a STOP sequence does not have a resource. But the STOP 
type will go away too since we will have a steps count in the platform 
data instead.

Power sequences only rely on pwm_get, and never call pwm_request since 
it is, as you stated, deprecated. However there are still boards that 
use the old pwm_id member of the pwm_backlight_platform_data. For these, 
we must call pwm_request from the pwm_backlight driver in order to 
resolve the PWM (see pwm_backlight_legacy_probe of the seconds patch). 
As the PWM is being resolved by the backlight driver, and not within the 
power sequences parser, the resolved data structure must be visible to 
pwm_backlight so it can construct it. There are two ways to solve this 
and keep the power sequences structure private:

1) Add a way to resolve a PWM by id using pwm_request in the power 
sequences (we probably should not do that)
2) Port the old platform pwm_request code to use pwm_add_table and 
pwm_get instead.

Do I get points if I do 2)? :)

Thanks,
Alex.
