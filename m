It doesn't control I2C5. However, I2C5 and the dfll I2C controller control
the same pins. There is some arbitration logic which prevents both controllers
driving the pins at the same time. This logic does not have a sw interface.
However, this logic doesn't work if I2C5 is not clocked. So once the dfll
is enabled, I2C5 must always be clocked.

Cheers,

Peter.
