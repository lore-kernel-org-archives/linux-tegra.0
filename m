While it is apparently true that each region can be split arbitrarily this
doesn't seem to be true for the partitioning of each region between the
individual ports.

For instance, while non-prefetchable memory could possibly be mapped either
to 0x90000000 or to 0xa0000000 with an arbitrary size, the subregion that is
assigned to port 0 or 1 seems to be fixed. Judging by the code this current=
ly
seems to be evenly distributed, but it's not so clear how this behaves when
port 1 for example is disabled, or how it is distributed on Tegra30 with all
three ports enabled (split into 3 equally-sized partitions?).

While the upstream driver currently still initializes the I/O and memory
resources for each port (splitting them into equally-sized partitions), the
latest downstream driver no longer seems to do so, but instead just
initializes a global resource for each resource type (tegra_pcie_preinit()).

I hope the improved documentation that you already requested will shed some
light on this.
