I had a similar thought about making this checking and the "proper" unmapping
optional, but decided that it is not very worthy to implement it now because
caching of mappings helps to get rid of all IOVA expenses. The "checking" is
nearly "free" in terms of performance, it's the unmapping that causes measurable
performance impact. Maybe the improper unmapping was made intentionally for
better performance.

Given that you've made suggestion to make the checking optional, I'm going to
update this patchset, adding a new "debug" Kconfig option.
