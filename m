Please specifically refer to commit:

  b13b1d2d8692b437 ("x86/mm: In the PTE swapout page reclaim case clear the accessed bit instead of flushing the TLB")

... so that it's easy for people to track down the relevant x86 change.

Can we just copy the x86 comment from commit b13b1d2d8692b437?

Thanks,
