How about some new APIs called ...

pm_runtime_enable_get()
pm_runtime_enable_get_sync()
pm_runtime_put_disable() (implies a put_sync)

... and in these APIs we add ...

pm_runtime_enable_get(dev)
{
	if (!CONFIG_PM && dev->pm_ops->resume)
		return dev->pm_ops->resume(dev);

	pm_runtime_enable(dev);
	return pm_runtime_get(dev);
}

None, but seems overkill just for this case.
