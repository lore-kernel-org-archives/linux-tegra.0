No, I don't think so.

The I2C binding model is that each child of an I2C controller represents 
a device attached to the bus. which SW will communicate with using the 
I2C controller as master and the device as a slave. If there's no 
explicit representation of child-vs-slave in the DT, how does the I2C 
core know whether a particular node is intended to be accessed as a 
master or slave?

In other words, without an explicit "communicate with this device" or 
"implement this device as a slave" flag, how could DT contain:

i2c-controller {
     ...
     master@1a {
         compatible = "foo,device";
         reg = <0x1a 1>;
     };
     slave@1a {
         compatible = "foo,device-slave";
         reg = <0x1a 1>;
     };
};

where:

- "foo,device" means: instantiate a driver to communicate with a device 
of this type.

- "foo,device-slave" means: instantiate a driver to act as this I2C device.

Sure it's possible for the drivers for those two nodes to simply use the 
I2C subsystem's master or slave APIs, but I suspect DT content would 
confuse the I2C core into thinking that two I2C devices with the same 
address had been represented in DT, and the I2C core would refuse to 
instantiate one of them. The solution here is for the reg value to 
encode a "master" vs. "slave" flag, so the I2C core can allow both a 
master and a slave for each address.

I'm pretty sure this is the nth time I've explained this.
