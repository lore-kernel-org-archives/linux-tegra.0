This really depends on the device vs. no device decision below. If we can
make it work without needing an extra device for it, then using the index
is certainly better. However, if we instantiate devices from the DT, then
we have the address anyway and adding the index as a property would be
redundant and error prone (what happens if somebody sets the index of the
port at address 0x80000000 to 2?).

That doesn't necessarily mean it is correct. The representation of the
device tree (as in the Linux kernel device tree) isn't quite accurate
because you're missing the link of the host bridge to the parent PCIe
controller. It also means that the representation of the kernel device
tree doesn't match the DT representation.

Additionally, if you look at how PCI busses and devices are matched to
their respective DT nodes, the code in drivers/pci/of.c provides a
default implementation of pcibios_get_phb_of_node(), which matches the
struct pci_bus up with the device_node of the parent device.

If we keep the current implementation that passes NULL as parent to the
pci_scan_root_bus() function, then we'll have to provide a custom
implementation of pcibios_get_phb_of_node() which has to go through
similar hoops as the x86 version (see arch/x86/kernel/devicetree.c).
That of course will not contribute to improving the current state of
fragmentation in the PCI subsystem.
