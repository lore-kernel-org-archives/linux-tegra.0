Yes. I'd expect those to be maintained per-client, and so the clock core
(or whatever higher level code implements clk_set_floor/ceiling)
performs the logic that "blends" together all the different requests
from different clients.

As an aside, for audio usage, I would expect clk_set_rate to be a
per-client (rather than per HW clock) operation too, and to error out if
one client says it wants to set pll_a to the rate needed for
44.1KHz-based audio and a different client wants the rate for
48KHz-based audio.

At a high level, yes this sounds about right to me.
