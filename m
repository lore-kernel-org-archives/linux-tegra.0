These would also need some kind of usecounting I guess, since genpd
otherwise relies on runtime PM to do the usecounting.

This overall seems like a reasonable approach to solve the problem we
have. While we discussed this approach at connect, we thought it would
be a good idea to bring out some RFC on these lines to get the
discussion going. Do you think you would be able to work on some quick 
RFC around these lines, else if you think you would be busy in the near 
term I can help with hacking up the changes as well.

regards,
Rajendra
