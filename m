I wouldn't have any objections to that if the hoops were reasonable
ones. What you're asking me to do is basically implement a second copy
of the logbuf. I don't call that a reasonable hoop to jump through. It
is also not guaranteed to work properly because we can always end up
with a situation where we produce more data than we can consume. Also,
by providing this additional buffer we make things worse because the
standard mechanisms of the logbuf are side-stepped. Typically the logbuf
code will warn if it overflows. In our case we provide a buffer that the
console can dump into, so instead of the logbuf overflowing and warning
about it, we'd now overflow the mailbox buffer and we'd have to add
extra code to warn about overflows.

The console really only works because it assumes that the output driver
will stall and thereby rate-limit.

No, that's not true. On the receiving end of the TX mailbox is a micro-
processor that reads out the mailbox data. Once it has read the data it
needs to clear the FULL bit so that the TCU driver can write more data.
Even if the microprocessor on the receiving end did buffering (there is
no indication that it does) it would eventually run out of buffer space
and have to stall until it's clocked all the characters out of the
physical UART. At that point no amount of buffering is going to save us
and the only option is to stall, which, again, can currently only be
done from the mailbox, because it is the only one that knows when it is
busy. But it's also the one place where we can't because the framework
doesn't allow it.

Look, I'd be willing to push this all into the driver, but the framework
doesn't allow me to do that. If it was possible to run the state machine
outside of mbox_send_message() then I'd be able to just move the busy
loop or flush into the driver. But the locking is such that I can't do
that because it will cause a deadlock.

The ringbuffer workaround would be very brittle and if at all only work
by accident, not to mention that it would require duplicating much of
the logbuf logic.

Also I don't consider usage in atomic context a very platform specific
use-case, and I don't understand why I should be required to resort to
some unreliable workaround rather than find a proper fix that guarantees
proper operation.
