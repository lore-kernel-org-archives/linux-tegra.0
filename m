I understand the above limitation. What I thought for the solution is
that I can make use of iommu_bus even before IOMMU is
instanciated. iommu_bus has its notifier which calls
iommu_ops()->add_device(). This could return -EPROBE_DEFER when IOMMU
isn't ready. Only the problem is the current "bus_notifier" doesn't
have the ability to return error. I'll see if it can be modified. Even
with this, at least IOMMU *driver* needs to be init'ed enough earlier
to prevent devices from being registered without IOMMU.

This looks somewhat similar to the above iommu_bus notifier.

Is there any way to implement the same mechanism rather than using
bus?
