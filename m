I would have thought something like -1 would be good enough to represent
an invalid GPIO, but if there's already a convention then we should
follow it.

I generally like the idea. I'm Cc'ing the devicetree-discuss mailing
list, let's see what people there think about it. I've also added Mitch
Bradley who already helped a lot with the initial binding.

I believe these shouldn't be a problem.

That isn't possible. But you could for instance use a cell to specify
the type of the following phandle.

OTOH we basically end up describing a code sequence in the DT. But as
you mention above sometimes the hardware requires specific timing
parameters so this might actually be a kind of valid sequence to
describe in the DT.
