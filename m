With all due respect, this doesn't seem to add any new information.
For example, the L1 PM Substates Control 1 register description from
the above is basically identical to the published PCIe r3.1, sec
7.33.3.

So it doesn't answer the questions of:

  1) Why coreboot sets the L1.2 threshold to a fixed value, and

  2) How "(1 << 21) | (1 << 23) | (1 << 30)" relates to the Control 1
     register

I don't have access to this document.  The Linux code I'm proposing is
based on the PCIe spec and is intended to work on all hardware that
conforms to that spec.  I'm not very familiar with coreboot, but maybe
the L1 Substates code there is only intended to work on certain Intel
chipsets and doesn't need to work on other hardware?
