There is a patch that you just re-post to linux-mmc tree (mmc: tegra:
use mmc_of_parse to get the support of standard MMC DT bindings). This
series need the patch to make sure everything work.

Because the DT of Tegra114 didn't describe any PMC suspend information.
So the driver will prevent to register any platform suspend ops. The
result will something like below.

Tegra114 > echo mem > /sys/power/state
write error: No such device

Ah. I didn't add any protection here. It will be (c) due the LP2 mask. I
will add a protection in next version. Thanks for remind.

BTW, I want to mention one thing about PMC DT bindings. Because I can't
add all of the PMC DT bindings in one time, the PMC is related to too
many devices to work for runtime PM and power domain control. And some
wake up sources control for deep sleep mode (LP0). They are still under
developing for upstream. May I add more bindings for PMC later?

Thanks,
Joseph
