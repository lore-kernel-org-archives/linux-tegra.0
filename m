Because the period is often directly extracted from the DT, and this
extracted period may not match the one configured by the bootloader.

If the driver wants to display the current status without changing the
PWM state, then the driver will use the current state. ITOH, if it
has to apply a new config, the driver will use the default period
value (extracted from the DT) and change the duty-cycle depending on it=
s
needs.
This is the case we have with the pwm-regulator driver: we want to
display the initial voltage value without changing the PWM config, and
when someone decides to change the voltage, we want to use the default
period instead of keeping the one configured by the bootloader.

Best Regards,

Boris
