Yes. The secure OS really has to have enabled the appropriate WARs
before jumping into the kernel's reset vector. If/when we support the
upstream kernel running on Tegra in non-secure mode, the plan was to use
a Tegra-specific mechanism to detect secure-vs-normal mode in the Tegra
reset vector, and skip the application of secure-only WARs based on that.

I had a downstream discussion about this, and Bo Yan said someone had
verified this was working correctly for at least for some WARs on some
CPUs and for the one particular secure OS we're using.

I think it's reasonable to require a fixed secure OS (i.e. one that
correctly enables any required WARs) be used with any upstream kernel,
since running in normal world would be a new feature that we'd be
supporting.

An SMC to read/write the diag register sounds the opposite of secure...

Yes, that could work.
