The case is more like this:
1. DMA interrupt "completes" DMA.  Schedules tasklet to do DMA callback
2. DMA callback to uart starts to execute.  This will read data off the buffer
and restart the DMA.  This is done under spinlock.
3. Some time during this callback, UART interrupt is raised for whatever
reason, EORD or character timeout.  UART waits to acquire port spinlock.
4. DMA callback gives up spinlock after reading data, but before restarting DMA.
5. UART isr gets spin lock and now reads the same DMA buffer because DMA has not
restarted and terminate_all, etc. will operate on the values from the last DMA.

I don't know the history, but I suppose the two exist to catch every reason why
we might want to read data in.  Theoretically we don't need the DMA callback and
can just rely on character timeout interrupt to handle DMA completion.  I
removed the DMA callback just now as a test and it didn't seem to have any ill
effects.  Perhaps there's a decrease in throughput?  Maybe we should put more
consideration into that.

This has been the case before this change so we've been getting lucky a lot.
Noted though.

This is actually pretty close to the first solution I came up with for the
issue.  It worked for me in all of the cases I saw. I'll paste below.

I *think* you're right and that we should still check for DMA_ERROR in
rx_dma_complete.  I'm honestly a bit more fond of this approach so if it makes
sense then we can move forward with it instead.  But actually now I'm really
interested if we can be done with the rx_dma_complete callback completely!
