I get the round_rate ops part. But I don't see a need to force a 
recalc_rate ops. Can we just check for the existence of .set_rate() to 
figure out if the clock will take up the rate of the parent or will 
output a different rate?

Sorry, this still doesn't make much sense to me. This essentially means 
we can't trust the HW to do what we are asking it to do?

CPUfreq and devfreq are clients of external clock APIs. That's different 
from whether the HW will do what the platform driver will ask it to.

Even if this unusual HW exists, I certainly don't want to deal with 
recalc_rate(). It's also quite a bit of register reads that I would like 
to avoid. I want to keep the clock APIs as fast as I can since it 
affects power.

Can we do something like this in clk_change_rate()?

if (ops->set_rate) {
	ops->set_rate(clk->new_rate,...);
	clk->rate = clk->new_rate;
} else {
	clk->rate = clk->parent->rate;
}

if (ops->recalc_rate()) {
	clk->rate = ops->recalc_rate(...);
}

This code also makes the assumptions more intuitive and easy to understand.

I agree that anyone implementing .set_rate should also provide 
.round_rate. May be we should enforce that in clk_init/clk_register?

But can we please the above "if" check more explicit? "Your rate has to 
be same as the parent rate since you don't implement set rate" is 
clearer than "Your rate has to be the same as the parent rate since you 
don't implement round rate".

	if (!clk->ops->set_rate) {
		top = clk_calc_new_rates(clk->parent, rate);
		new_rate = clk->parent->new_rate;

		goto out;
	}

Thanks,
Saravana
