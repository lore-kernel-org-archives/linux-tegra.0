It might work for few but it isn't an alternative which is maintainable.

Olof proposed to have a common code which can be executed before kernel boot
in recent Linaro connect multi-platform discussion.
Though there was no conclusion on where this file can be part of kernel source
tree. Just form errata WA version control perspective, its is best to have such
errata WA as part of kernel code instead of spreading it over boot-loader, kernel
and firmware/sleep code.

Some of these errata's needs to be enabled before MMU gets enabled and as
discussed in past, we can still get this with 1:1 mapping code once
the SOCs are detected. This can potentially avoid the difficult patching
part for boot CPU which is proposed to be handled in boot-loader. We can
then potentially let the secondary CPUs also execute the same code before
getting into secondary_startup()

And if possible also re-use this code for CPU sleep code as well though
this one isn't must have since this part is already manageable in platform
sleep code.
