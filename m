I was hoping people could start doing tests, before Chris actually
decided to pull them in. Now, if that doesn't happen, we could just
merge them, as you say, and thus we have to fix potential problems
afterwards. I would expect you to help out if problem occurs.

If we decide to not merge in a while, I am not sure how long we could
prevent other sdhci patches from being merged. I guess Chris will have
to take the final call.
