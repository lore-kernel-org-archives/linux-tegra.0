OK, so just to paraphrase what you've said, to make sure I understand it:

On Tegra114, there are 3 registers:

1) Controls just the clock source of the G cluster.
2) Controls just the clock source of the LP cluster.
3) Controls both at the same time, simulating a write to both (1) and (2)

In tegra30_switch_cpu_to_clk32k(), we use register (3) above to switch
to clk_m then clk_s. This is possible, because in both registers (1) and
(2), the values for clk_m and clk_s are identical.

In tegra30_lp1_reset(), we can't use the same technique (a write to
register 3) to restore the clock source for both G and LP clusters,
since the values we need to write to those registers to re-select their
clock source is different.

however, on Tegra30, there really is only one register, so we can use
that to both switch to clk_m/clk_s, /and/ to switch back.

That all explains the following part of patch 7/8, which disables the
clock register restore path except on Tegra30 where it will work:

> -	mov32	r4, ((1 << 28) | (0x8))	@ burst policy is PLLX

> +	movteq	r4, #:upper16:((1 << 28) | (0x8))
> +	streq	r4, [r0, #CLK_RESET_CCLK_BURST]

However, none of this explains why the CPU clock restore logic on
Tegra114 needs to be a syscore_op, rather than simply having
tegra30_lp1_reset() execute some Tegra114-specific code.

Re-writing the part of the patch I quoted above in C, it looks like:

if (soc is tegra30)
    write to CLK_RESET_CCLK_BURST to select pllx

Instead of making that code do nothing on Tegra114, why can't that code be:

if (soc is tegra30)
    write to CLK_RESET_CCLK_BURST to re-select pllx
else
    write to G-cluster-specific register to restore saved value
    write to LP-cluster-specific register to restore saved value

or:

if (soc is tegra30)
    write to CLK_RESET_CCLK_BURST to re-select pllx
else
    write to G-cluster-specific register to re-select pllx/dfll/...
    write to LP-cluster-specific register to restore ...

Plenty of other registers are saved/restored by tegra30_lp1_reset(), so
surely you just need to have save two more registers in the suspend
path, and restore them as I showed above.

That way, we don't have to have some special-case syscore_op to do this;
all chips will restore the clock sources at the exact same place in the
code, and everything will be consistent.
