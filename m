Yes that sounds reasonable. Are you filtering on clock ID? Would it work
to allow the caller to pass a filter function which takes a struct *clk
as it's only argument?  Or do you prefer we call
of_parse_phandle_with_args(np, "clocks", "#clock-cells", i, &clkspec)
and return the clkspec info?

This function will return an error when pm_clk_add_clk() is called if
the user has not called pm_clk_create() first. It seems more natural to
me that the user should call pm_clk_create() before calling
pm_clk_add_clks_of() which is the same convention used for adding clocks
by the other APIs to add clocks.

Right, however, this will remove all clocks associated with the device
and not just those we have added. It is probably very unlikely that
someone would call pm_clk_add_clks_of() and had previously called
pm_clk_add(), but it seems best to not make any assumptions and only
remove the clocks that were actually added. I guess that it would be
possible to check to see if there were any clocks already added when
this function is called and return an error in that case.

All of that said, I do agree that it may be simpler, if we do call
pm_clk_create() from within pm_clk_add_clks_of() and this would allow us
to pmc_clk_destroy() in the error path. So if this is preferred I could
do that, but I think that I would not allow clocks to be added if
clock_list is not empty when this function is called.

Cheers
Jon
