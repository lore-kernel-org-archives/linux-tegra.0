That was precisely why I wanted to let this out of the binding for now
so that we can actually focus on making existing hardware work rather
than speculate about what we may or may not need.

If you think the current minimal binding will cause future use-cases to
break, then we should change it to avoid that. What you're proposing is
to make the binding more complex on the assumption that we'll get it
right.

Wouldn't it be safer to keep things to the bare minimum necessary to
represent hardware that we have access to and understand now, rather
than speculating about what may be necessary at some point. I'd much
prefer to add complexity on an as-needed basis and when we have a better
understand of where we're headed.

That was always my impression as well. But how then do you represent the
full 4 GiB address space in a 32-bit system? It starts at 0 and ends at
4 GiB - 1, which makes it 4 GiB large. That's:

	<0 1 0>

With #address-cells =3D <1> and #size-cells =3D <1> the best you can do is:

	<0 0xffffffff>

but that's not accurate.

Okay, so what Dave and you have been saying strongly indicates that
dma-ranges isn't the right thing to use here.

As I understand the Tegra SMMU allows each of the clients to be assigned
a separate address space (4 GiB on earlier generations and 16 GiB on new
generations) and all addresses in each address space can be mapped to
arbitrary physical addresses.

Isn't that the equivalent of the "whole address space" default that I
mentioned in the commit message? Could this be handled with
#address-cells =3D <1> and #size-cells =3D <0> in the iommu node? That way
the only cell that needs to be specified in iommus would be the ID and
the redundant address space could be simply omitted from DT since it
would be implied by the compatible string.
