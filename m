I like to have this in tegraN N.dtsi file becasue:
- This policy is not going to change the board to board. For high speed 
driver the uarta will be ttyTHS0 and uartb ttyTHS1.
- In board file I will only enable driver and make compatible, not worry 
about the making aliases.

This approach will simplify the instantiation. This will also avoid 
confusion like the aliases get added or not when we create board dts file.
This will be on same line we have with board files where pdev->id is 
fixed for all board in common place i.e. device.c which decide the 
port-number.
