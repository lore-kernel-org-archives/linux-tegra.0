Well, the reason I ask is that if the SMMU clients know which SMMU
they're affected by, it's easy for them to implement deferred probe. If
the SMMU knows which clients it affects, the clients won't have access
to that information, and hence implementing deferred probe will be hard.
That then impacts what might be the preferred style of DT bindings for
SMMUs. Of course, that is driver implementation details forcing a
particular DT binding, which isn't great, but I expect similar issues
would exist on any OS, so this doesn't seem too terrible in this case.
