The relevant driver can /request/ each special function independently but if
the pinmux driver can't implement it for whatever reason, including being
batshit-crazy like Tegra, it can just return an error.  It's still up to the
board designer to ensure the requested setup is physically possible.

To me that all looks like it can be encapsulated by this interface

This pin configuration stuff should be bunted to gpiolib gpio_config()
callbacks which Linus implemented last week.

Neat!  Should be a perfect use-case for this pinmux subsystem.  Perhaps,
if you've got time, you could try and implement a pinmux driver for your
chip and make sure all bases are covered?  Nothing like taking a madhouse
chip and actually trying to code for it to shake down a new interface like
this one :)
