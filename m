I had a look at it, but I haven't found the rootcause.

Sortof. The rootcause for this one is that pll_p gets disabled when
sdhci_tegra_probe() calls  clk_disable(). pll_p also provides the input clock
for UARTD however, so the next printk() call will hang the system. The reason
for this is that no kernel driver has actually enabled the UARTD clock at that
point, and thus pll_p hasn't been turned on from a clock framework point of
view.
Workaround is to enable UARTD in board-dt-tegra30 like we do for tegra20. I
guess we need a better solution to cope with a different UART being the
console UART. (See next mail)

Cheers,

Peter.
