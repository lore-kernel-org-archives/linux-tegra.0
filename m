DEBUG_UNCOMPRESS was previously disallowed for Tegra due to tegra.S's
use of global data that was not linked into the decompressor. Solve this
by declaring this symbol in tegra.S when it is being built into the
decompressor. For the kernel proper, leave the declaration in
mach-tegra/common.c as explained in the comment.

v2: Don't select DEBUG_UNCOMPRESS with DEBUG_TEGRA_UART unless
    !ZBOOT_ROM. Add notes on ZBOOT_ROM to comment.

Russell, I assume this should go in through the ARM patch tracker. Or,
do you want me to take it through the Tegra tree?

+ * In the kernel proper, this data is located in arch/arm/mach-tegra/common.c.

+ *
+ * In the decompressor, we put the symbol/storage right here, since common.c
+ * isn't included in the decompressor build. This symbol gets put in .text
+ * even though it's really data, since .data is discarded from the
+ * decompressor. Luckily, .text is writeable in the decompressor, unless
+ * CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM. That dependency is handled in arch/arm/Kconfig.debug.
