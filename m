One idea is that, rather than inserting a hook(function) per
subsystems in driver core, if we invent a new /special section/ which
collects all hooks in sequence like initcalls, the subsystem just
would declare a hook function for that special section. All hooks in
that section can be called from driver core iterately. Then we
wouldn't touch driver core code at all, once we insert a func to call
hooks repeatedly. Looks simpler than tweaking bus notifier.
