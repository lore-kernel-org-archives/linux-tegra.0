Yes, to warn if the IRQ is enabled but not a wake-up source ...

	if (irqd_is_wakeup_set(&desc->irq_data)) {
		...
	} else if (!irq_chip_pm_suspended(&desc->irq_data)) {
		...
	}

Yes, but this will not turn off the irqchip. It is legitimate for the
chip to be enabled during suspend if an IRQ is enabled as a wakeup.

The purpose of the warning is to report any IRQs that are enabled at
this point, but NOT wake-up sources. These could be unintentionally be
keeping the chip active when it does not need to be.

No there should not be. Remember this is an else-if and ONLY if an IRQ
is not a wake-up source AND enabled will you get a warning.

True, but surely they should have a wake-up enabled then? If not you are
wasting power unnecessarily.

I realise that this is different to how interrupts for irqchips work
today, but when we discussed this before, the only way to ensure that we
can power-down an irqchip with PM is if all IRQs are freed [0]. So it is
a slightly different mindset for irqchips with PM, that may be we
shouldn't hold references to IRQs forever if we are not using them.

I understand what you are saying, but at least in my mind if would be
better if the clients of the IRQ chips using PM freed their interrupts
when entering suspend. Quite possibly I am overlooking a use-case here
or overhead of doing this, but it would avoid every irqchip having to
handle this themselves and having a custom handler.

If this is strongly opposed, I would concede to making this a pr_debug()
as I think it could be useful.
