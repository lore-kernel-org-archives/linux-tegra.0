I didn't mention pci_fixup_irqs() by name in the notes, but that's
part of what I meant by "device setup being done by initcalls" as a
hot-plug issue.  I know Myron Stowe expressed interest in working on
that, but I don't think he's had a chance to do anything yet (at
least, I haven't seen anything yet).

I don't have time to fix it myself, so moving it forward is just a
matter of somebody doing the work and posting the patches.  I think
that code just needs to be moved to some pcibios hook (possibly a new
one) that's called in the device_add path.
