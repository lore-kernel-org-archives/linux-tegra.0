I strongly disagree, it almost perfectly describes the hardware. Unlike 
on I2c where modelling a bus is enough to allow generic user space 
access unfortunately on SPI this is not enough as it requires a specific 
chip-select as well. This is exactly what spidev does and maps to our 
hardware perfectly which has one dedicated chip-select per SPI bus on a 
dedicated header which allows our customers out-of-the-box spidev user 
space access to almost any SPI device connected to those buses just like 
with i2c-devs on I2C buses.
