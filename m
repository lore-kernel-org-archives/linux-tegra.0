Yeah, that's a non-starter. :(

I fear that someone may validly have a clocks property in their root GIC
node, at which point things would fall apart. I was under the impression
this was the case for some Renesas boards (though I didn't find an
example in tree).

So I suspect that using the clocks property in that way isn't going to
work out well.

> Mark, what are your thoughts on this?

Collectively: "aargh", "oh no".

We could instead explicitly match "nvidia,tegra210-agic", bailing out if
we see that. Otherwise, if we can't handle it like a GIC-400, then we
can just drop the GIC-400 compatible string from the fallback list.

Thanks,
Mark.
