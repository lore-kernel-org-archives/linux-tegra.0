Actually my patch is intend to fix 1) IMX incorrect max timeout issue
2) should not use max_clock
to calculate max_discard_to issue for using SDCLK as timeout clock.
The issue discussed here is a different issue that the card timeout
may still be bigger than
the host capability and how to use discard for such case.
So your problem may exist if you meet some more big timeout cards.
For IMX, when running at 50Mhz, the max timeout is more than 5s.
It looks bigger enough currently and i tested many eMMC cards(Samsung,
Toshiba, Sandisk, Hynix)
and all they worked well with discard after fix.
I don't know which eMMC cards you meet the issue and don't know what
is Tegra max timeout.
Just for SD3.0 cards working on 200Mhz, i observed one Toshiba
SDHC U1 card could not do discard, since its AU erase timeout is 2s+
which exceeds the host
capability 1335ms. Thus discard is automatically disabled.
But another Sandisk SDXC can still work well since it has small
ERASE_OFFSET as 1s.
