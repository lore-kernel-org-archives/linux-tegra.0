The driver needs other resources than what ahci_platform currently manages (at least reset_controls and multiple regulators, later we might get more) and managing them in the driver allows the driver to do proper error handling and manage all resources consistently and in one place. Also, I don't think it is sensible to add support for loading every possible kind of DT resource to ahci_platform, since most drivers won't need them.

Sure, I'll have a go at it. I already sent one bugfix for 
libahci_platform anyway :)
