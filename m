Hi,
By the looks of this you configure wake events but the pmc driver
still only configures lp1, which is the same as linux 4 tegra 4.4+
which also doesn't support lp0, if its selected in dts it'll just
change it to LP1/SC7 (both have same code path and neither set any lp0
stuff trm says). What confuses me further is that l4t and this
ptachset both configure wake events, which I think should only work in
LP0 and not LP1 and yet neither have lp0 entry code for t210. I also
looked at ATF, whis sets the flags to wake the cpu on interrupts,
which would suggest that it only supports lp1 (in deep sleep I dont
think them flags would work). Am I missing some important detail here?
Two other things, will you be adding full lp0 in later patchets and
will they use the bpmp or not?
