The devfreq subsystem seems to be more oriented towards a device (like GPU or CPU) that controls the power/performance characteristics by itself and not the performance of other devices. The main problem of using it is that it's using a reactive approach - for example monitor some performance counters and then reconfigure bandwidth after some bottleneck has already occurred. This is suboptimal and might not work well. The new solution does the opposite by allowing drivers to express their needs in advance and be proactive. Devfreq also does not seem suitable for configuring complex, multi-tiered bus topologies and aggregating constraints provided by drivers.

Here are links to some of the examples that are on the mailing list already. I really should have  included them in the cover letter. 
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/12/7/584
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/11/499
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/20/986
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/22/772

Platforms drivers for different SoCs are available:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/17/368
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/8/10/380
There is a discussion on linux-pm about supporting also Tegra platforms in addition to NXP and Qualcomm.

It allows the consumer drivers to dynamically express their performance needs in the system in a more fine grained way (if they want/need to) and this helps the system to keep the lowest power profile. This has already been done for a long time in various different kernels shipping with Android devices, for example, and basically every vendor uses a different custom approach. So I believe that this is doing the generalization that was needed.

Sure, hope that this answers your questions.
