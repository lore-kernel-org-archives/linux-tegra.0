Yes, sounds good. May be it is simpler just to add a new member and let
the platform genpd driver handle it.

I am wondering if in addition to pm_genpd_remove(), we then just have a
function called pm_genpd_remove_tail(), which allows you to pass the
struct device pointer and will remove the last pm-domain from the
gpd_list and return the genpd pointer if successful. Internally, it will
call pm_genpd_remove(). It seems to me that if there are nested
pm-domains, then we probably want to remove them starting from the tail
as opposed to the head.

How does that sound?

Cheers
Jon
