That's rather hard to understand. How about:

==========
Add support to the Tegra CPU reset vector to detect whether the CPU is
resuming from LP1 suspend state. If it is, branch to the LP1-specific
resume code.

When Tegra enters the LP1 suspend state, the SDRAM controller is placed
into a self-refresh state. For this reason, we must place the LP1 resume
code into IRAM, so that it is accessible before SDRAM access has been
re-enabled.
==========

Talking about *copying* the LP1 resume code to IRAM isn't appropriate
here, since nothing in this patch performs any copying of the resume code.

On thumb, lr==#1 at this point. I think you want to move the THUMB()
instruction after the bleq.

The layout of IRAM should be described in irammap.h not sleep.h.
